02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:57,208
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1259
02:00:58,542 --> 02:01:00,670
Before they could cross, however...

1260
02:01:00,836 --> 02:01:04,924
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1261
02:01:05,174 --> 02:01:09,053
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1262
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:12,306
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1263
02:01:12,473 --> 02:01:14,517
But Death was cunning.

1264
02:01:15,184 --> 02:01:18,187
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1265
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:23,609
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1266
02:01:24,193 --> 02:01:28,739
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1267
02:01:28,906 --> 02:01:33,536
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1268
02:01:34,912 --> 02:01:39,250
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1269
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:43,838
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1270
02:01:44,255 --> 02:01:48,592
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1271
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:53,264
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1272
02:01:54,473 --> 02:01:55,933
A humble man...

1273
02:01:56,058 --> 02:02:00,271
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1274
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:03,607
...without being followed by Death.

1275
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:10,614
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1276
02:02:13,951 --> 02:02:16,912
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1277
02:02:17,079 --> 02:02:19,165
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1278
02:02:19,332 --> 02:02:23,127
...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

1279
02:02:25,296 --> 02:02:28,841
Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...

1280
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:32,094
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1281
02:02:35,097 --> 02:02:38,601
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1282
02:02:38,768 --> 02:02:41,896
...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1283
02:02:42,104 --> 02:02:45,524
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1284
02:02:46,275 --> 02:02:48,235
The second brother journeyed
to his home...

1285
02:02:48,402 --> 02:02:51,363
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.

1286
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:55,993
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...

1287
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:58,537
...appeared before him.

1288
02:02:59,038 --> 02:03:04,335
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1289
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,128
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1290
02:03:06,295 --> 02:03:09,632
...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.

1291
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,928
And so Death took the second brother.

1292
02:03:14,095 --> 02:03:15,721
As for the third brother...

1293
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:20,142
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.

1294
02:03:20,309 --> 02:03:23,187
Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...

1295
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:27,650
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
and give it to his son.

1296
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:33,030
He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...
