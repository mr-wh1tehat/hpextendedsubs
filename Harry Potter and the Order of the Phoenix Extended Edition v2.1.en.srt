1
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,428
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,933
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,812
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,648
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,651
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,570
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,448
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,829
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,374
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,418
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,131
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,133
Hey, Big D.

13
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,635
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,304
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:23,143
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,565
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,570
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,655
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,994
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,663
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,125
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,335
She dead?

23
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,171
Is she dead?

24
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,007
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,023
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,777
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,906
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,616
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,918
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,955
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,611
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,576
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,245
They might come back.

34
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,499
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,628
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,006
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,551
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,555
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,391
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,227
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,522
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:01,360
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,164
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,458
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,543
Diddykins?

46
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,879
Is that you?

47
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,219
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,430
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,724
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,897
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,901
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,904
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,408
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,744
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,748
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,764
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:17,186
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:22,108
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,360
As a clear violation...

60
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,614
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,908
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,787
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:39,917
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,382
Justice.

65
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,813
He's not very well.

66
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,161
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,146
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,400
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,905
Professor Moody.

70
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,409
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,998
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,583
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,793
But the letter said...

74
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,963
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,299
...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,844
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,305
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,309
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,776
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,620
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,123
Come on.

82
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,331
In you go, son.

83
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,376
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,253
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,297
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:59,385
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,686
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,064
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,401
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,989
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,245
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,417
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,632
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,929
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,764
Yeah.

97
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:53,230
Mudblood, werewolves,
traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:58,277
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,738
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,783
Oh, the shame.

101
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,882
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,469
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,263
Kreacher is here.

104
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,769
Oh, Harry.

105
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:38,400
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,403
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,783
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,118
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,996
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,124
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,962
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,840
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,133
It's a secret society.

114
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,845
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,597
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,475
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,688
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,897
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,276
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,779
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,325
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,452
I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,455
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,833
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,045
- Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,715
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,386
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,597
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,348
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,893
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,104
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,440
He's as good as.

133
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,525
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,111
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,406
Perhaps Potter will grow up
to be a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,325
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,577
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,579
- About your supposed reformation.

139
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,498
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,375
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,169
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,755
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,174
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,804
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,725
Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

146
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,978
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,190
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,942
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,653
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,447
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,783
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,787
Sirius.

153
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,795
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,632
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,260
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,598
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,986
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,827
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,163
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,623
Why?

161
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,750
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,044
No one in their right mind
could believe that...

163
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,089
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,800
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,887
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,515
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,019
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,106
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,192
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:13,157
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,952
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,707
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,336
He's been recruiting heavily, and we've
been attempting to do the same.

174
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,049
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,804
We believe...

176
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,724
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,017
Sirius.

178
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,523
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,027
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,239
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,242
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,205
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,552
Harry.

184
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,971
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,933
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,069
Trains. Underground.

187
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,530
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,549
Here we are.

189
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,805
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,852
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,769
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,231
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,401
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,176
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,388
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,517
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,068
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,070
They've changed the time
of your hearing.

199
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,613
When is it?

200
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,907
In five minutes.

201
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,793
Department of Mysteries.

202
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,466
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

203
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,760
Yes, but we must be...

204
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,312
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

205
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,024
Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.

206
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,611
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

207
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,446
Yes?

208
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,950
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

209
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,328
Good luck, Harry.

210
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,793
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

211
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,921
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

212
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,717
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

213
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,970
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

214
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,972
Witness for the defense.

215
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,308
Albus Percival Wulfric...

216
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,062
...Brian Dumbledore.

217
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,649
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

218
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,360
...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

219
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,489
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

220
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,660
The charges?

221
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,329
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

222
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,165
"That he did knowingly...

223
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,877
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

224
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,047
...produce a Patronus Charm...

225
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,467
...in the presence of a Muggle."

226
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,928
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

227
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,557
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

228
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,602
...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

229
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,147
Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot...

230
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,524
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

231
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,904
Dementors?

232
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,198
In Little Whinging?

233
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,700
That's quite clever.

234
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,037
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

235
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,414
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

236
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,167
- There were two of them, if I hadn't...
- Enough.

237
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,546
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
would be a very well-rehearsed story...

238
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,218
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

239
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,972
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

240
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,395
Please describe the attack.

241
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,983
What did they look like?

242
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:27,989
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

243
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,910
Not the boys. The Dementors.

244
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,747
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

245
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:41,545
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

246
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,590
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

247
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:50,846
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

248
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,641
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

249
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,560
I don't think anyone would believe...

250
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,771
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

251
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,152
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

252
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:10,824
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.

253
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:15,203
And it's so silly of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though...

254
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,374
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

255
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,335
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

256
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:26,673
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

257
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,218
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

258
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,763
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

259
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,850
Of course, there is someone...

260
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,811
...who might be behind the attack.

261
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,444
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

262
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:52,157
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

263
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,118
He is not back.

264
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,210
In the matter of Harry Potter...

265
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,213
...the law clearly states...

266
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,842
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

267
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,929
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

268
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,265
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

269
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,310
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

270
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,280
Those in favor of conviction?

271
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:46,044
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

272
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,394
Cleared of all charges.

273
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,190
Professor.

274
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,206
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

275
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,750
You'll blow the entire operation.

276
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,761
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

277
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,556
I had to see you off, didn't I?

278
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,852
What's life without a little risk?

279
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,396
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

280
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,023
Don't worry about me.

281
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,445
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

282
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,870
Original Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,122
Marlene McKinnon.

284
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,875
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

285
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,420
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

286
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,631
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

287
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,299
Neville's parents.

288
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,136
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

289
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,557
It's been 14 years.

290
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,604
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

291
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,944
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

292
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,659
It feels like it did before.

293
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,664
You keep it.

294
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,544
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

295
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,590
I'll see you at the train.

296
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,801
Bye-bye, darling.

297
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,178
I love you.

298
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,931
Hold my hand, lovey.

299
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,475
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

300
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,935
Bye.

301
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,063
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

302
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,731
Better enjoy it while you can.

303
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,193
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

304
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,741
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

305
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,786
It's only Malfoy.

306
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,456
What'd you expect?

307
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,602
Hi, guys.

308
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,437
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

309
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,035
What is it?

310
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,457
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

311
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,627
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

312
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,463
It's pulling itself, like always.

313
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,312
You're not going mad.

314
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,150
I can see them too.

315
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,987
You're just as sane as I am.

316
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,869
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

317
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,582
Luna Lovegood.

318
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,838
What an interesting necklace.

319
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,550
It's a charm, actually.

320
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,511
Keeps away the Nargles.

321
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,808
Hungry.

322
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,435
I hope there's pudding.

323
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,023
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

324
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,371
Good evening, children.

325
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,375
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

326
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,587
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

327
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,339
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

328
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,968
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

329
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,806
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

330
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,143
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

331
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,188
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

332
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,986
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

333
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,791
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

334
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:04,672
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

335
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,719
And how lovely to see all your bright...

336
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,722
...happy faces smiling up at me.

337
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:18,269
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

338
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,688
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

339
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,486
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

340
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:32,283
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

341
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,911
Although each headmaster...

342
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:39,916
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

343
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:47,632
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

344
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:52,178
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

345
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,848
...perfect what can be perfected...

346
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:02,647
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

347
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,825
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

348
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:18,329
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

349
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,249
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

350
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,002
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

351
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,524
Dean, Seamus.

352
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,943
- Good holiday?
- All right.

353
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,529
Better than Seamus', anyway.

354
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,199
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

355
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,661
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

356
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,457
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

357
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,958
What, your mum believes them?

358
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,044
Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

359
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,297
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

360
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,967
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar.

361
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,636
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

362
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,890
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

363
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,725
Yeah. I do.

364
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,686
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

365
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,616
My gran says it's the Daily Prophet
that's rubbish.

366
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,077
She's canceled our subscription.

367
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,041
- You all right?
- Fine.

368
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,002
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

369
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,340
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

370
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,431
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

371
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,877
Harry.

372
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,478
Bring it over here. Over here.

373
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,274
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

374
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,332
Good morning, children.

375
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:15,506
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

376
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,259
O-W-Ls.

377
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:23,014
More commonly known as OWLs.

378
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,309
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

379
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:31,898
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

380
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:42,533
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

381
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,869
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

382
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,539
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

383
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,375
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

384
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,338
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

385
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,048
Using spells?

386
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,676
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

387
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,971
We're not gonna use magic?

388
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:09,143
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

389
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,063
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

390
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,191
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

391
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,239
It is the view of the Ministry...

392
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,158
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

393
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,285
...to get you through
your examinations...

394
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,913
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

395
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,874
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

396
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,085
There is nothing out there, dear.

397
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,255
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

398
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,716
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

399
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:55,898
Now, let me make this quite plain.

400
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,900
You have been told...

401
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:03,447
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

402
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:08,744
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

403
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,538
Detention, Mr. Potter.

404
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,873
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

405
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,459
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

406
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,795
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

407
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,463
Enough!

408
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,799
Enough.

409
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:26,304
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

410
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,246
Come in.

411
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,420
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

412
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,338
Sit.

413
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,933
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

414
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,977
No, not with your quill.

415
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,397
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

416
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,945
Now...

417
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:31,786
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

418
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,748
How many times?

419
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,878
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

420
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,548
You haven't given me any ink.

421
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,217
Oh, you won't need any ink.

422
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,936
Yes?

423
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,655
- Nothing.
- That's right.

424
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,535
Because you know, deep down...

425
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,787
...you deserve to be punished.

426
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,124
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

427
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,963
Go on.

428
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,266
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

429
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,059
Get out of class whenever you like.

430
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,980
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

431
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,316
Care for another?

432
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,574
GIRL:
Yeah, that one.

433
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,294
I seen you. You're nothing
but a bloody cheat, you know that?

434
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,047
-I don't cheat.
-Oh, no. You don't cheat.

435
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,758
-Yeah, whatever.
-Come on, deal me in, Sheamus.

436
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,261
- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
- Oh, please.

437
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,389
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

438
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,683
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

439
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,604
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

440
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:08,025
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

441
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,157
What's wrong with your hand?

442
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,159
Nothing.

443
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,329
The other hand.

444
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,667
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

445
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,044
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

446
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,338
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

447
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,924
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

448
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,053
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

449
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,308
Harry, you've got to report this.

450
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:45,020
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

451
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,023
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

452
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,110
You don't understand.

453
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,614
Then help us to.

454
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,214
Dear Padfoot...

455
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,466
...I hope you're all right.

456
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:19,263
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

457
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,645
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

458
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,816
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

459
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,102
Hello, Harry Potter.

460
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,360
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

461
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:19,323
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

462
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,951
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

463
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,920
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

464
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:38,675
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

465
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,222
Different.

466
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,727
But why can't the others see them?

467
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,398
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

468
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,152
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

469
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,946
My mum.

470
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:04,410
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

471
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,871
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

472
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,416
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

473
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,210
Yes, it was rather horrible.

474
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:18,715
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

475
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,595
We both believe you, by the way.

476
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,643
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

477
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,938
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

478
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:37,443
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

479
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,944
I don't think that's true.

480
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,450
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

481
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,410
What do you mean?

482
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,912
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

483
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,958
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

484
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,836
...because if it's just you alone...

485
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,006
...you're not as much of a threat.

486
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:21,403
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

487
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,824
Harry.

488
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,911
Can I join you?

489
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,957
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

490
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,877
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

491
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,340
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

492
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,175
So silly of me, but it sounds...

493
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:47,471
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

494
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,972
...Minerva.

495
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,602
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

496
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,355
I am sorry, dear.

497
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,858
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

498
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,153
...and by extension,
the minister himself.

499
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,905
I am a tolerant woman...

500
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:10,160
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

501
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,705
Disloyalty.

502
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:19,378
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

503
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,048
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

504
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,353
What's happened to Dumbledore?

505
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,064
Having already revolutionized...

506
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,900
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

507
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:47,864
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as High Inquisitor, have powers...

508
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:53,829
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

509
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,931
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

510
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,558
Yes.

511
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,978
But you were unsuccessful?

512
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,481
Obviously.

513
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,021
Move those mouths.

514
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,491
TRELAWNEY:
Dream interpretation...

515
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:16,161
...is a most important
means of divination.

516
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:21,667
For the Inner Eye sees sights
to which the outer world is blind.

517
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,337
[TRELAWNEY COUGHING]

518
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,384
Uh!

519
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,264
Uh. Oh, uhh.

520
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,601
What are you doing here?

521
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,019
Don't mind me, dear.

522
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:45,857
-You see...Professor Trelawney, isn't it?
-Mm.

523
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,652
--In addition to my teaching duties,
the Ministry has asked me...

524
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,572
...to act as an informal observer
here at Hogwarts.

525
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,702
Cornelius' eyes and ears, as it were.

526
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,663
Nothing whatsoever to worry about.
Please do go on.

527
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,415
I'm just a fly on the wall.

528
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:05,127
Oh, yes, well. Well...

529
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,005
-Dream--
-Just one question, dear.

530
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:13,552
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

531
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,637
Um...

532
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,348
Nearly 16 years.

533
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,226
Quite a period.

534
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:26,690
And it was Dumbledore
who appointed you?

535
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,608
He did.

536
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,579
-The interpretation--
-Just one more thing...

537
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,080
...if it isn't too much bother.

538
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,043
Could you please
predict something for me?

539
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,422
-I'm sorry?
-Predict something.

540
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,258
Well, surely you're not surprised I ask.

541
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,261
You would have foreseen it.

542
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,182
Uh...uh.

543
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:09,816
The...the Inner Eye does
not see upon command.

544
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,568
Come, now.

545
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,780
One teensy little prophecy?

546
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,328
No?

547
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,711
Pity.

548
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,715
No, wait. Wait.
I think I do see something.

549
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,593
Yes, I do. Something dark.

550
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:41,264
You are in grave danger.

551
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,311
Lovely.

552
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,241
Cho. What's going on?

553
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,743
It's Professor Trelawney.

554
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,068
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

555
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,155
Hogwarts is my home.

556
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,950
You can't do this.

557
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,662
Actually, I can.

558
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,922
Something you'd like to say?

559
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,758
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

560
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,886
There...

561
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:19,487
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

562
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,241
Sybil, dear. This way.

563
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,910
Thank you.

564
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:30,123
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

565
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,543
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

566
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,880
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

567
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,634
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

568
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,845
That power remains
with the headmaster.

569
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,098
For now.

570
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,523
Don't you all have studying to do?

571
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,858
Professor.

572
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,819
Professor?

573
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,073
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

574
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,367
Professor Dumbledore.

575
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,171
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

576
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,882
We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.

577
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,718
We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.

578
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,137
She's taking over the entire school.

579
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:30,976
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

580
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,979
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

581
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,023
...that these disappearances
are the work...

582
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,568
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

583
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,904
Harry.

584
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,823
Sirius.

585
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,243
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

586
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,329
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

587
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,415
Training you to kill half-breeds?

588
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,584
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

589
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,964
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

590
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,173
Combat?

591
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,593
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

592
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,137
That's exactly what he thinks.

593
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,266
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

594
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,103
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

595
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,940
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

596
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,277
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

597
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,113
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

598
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,284
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

599
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,413
Voldemort is on the move.

600
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,206
Well, what can we do?

601
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,250
Someone's coming.

602
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,627
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

603
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:44,799
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

604
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,646
He really is out there, isn't he?

605
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,151
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

606
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:07,489
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how, we need someone who will.

607
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,674
Harry.

608
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,645
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

609
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,021
I'm a nutter, remember?

610
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:44,692
Look on the bright side: You can't be
any worse than old toad face.

611
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:48,405
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

612
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,241
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

613
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,535
Just a couple of people.

614
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,999
Lovely spot.

615
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,839
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

616
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,174
Matey, come back here.

617
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,767
Hi.

618
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,062
So you all know why we're here.

619
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,480
We need a teacher.

620
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,359
A proper teacher.

621
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:29,821
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

622
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,739
- Why?
- Why?

623
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,992
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

624
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,743
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

625
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,037
So Dumbledore says because he says.

626
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,582
The point is, where's the proof?

627
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,003
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

628
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,885
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

629
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,472
Come on, Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.

630
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,266
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

631
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,021
Yes.

632
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,940
I've seen it.

633
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,234
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

634
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:13,031
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

635
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,449
It's true.

636
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,368
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

637
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,456
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

638
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,957
Wait.

639
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:28,171
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

640
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,925
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

641
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,929
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

642
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:39,599
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

643
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:46,814
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

644
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,319
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

645
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,987
But out there...

646
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,866
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

647
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,745
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

648
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,333
You don't know what that's like.

649
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,011
You're right, Harry, we don't.

650
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,847
That's why we need your help.

651
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,934
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

652
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,312
...Voldemort...

653
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,484
He's really back.

654
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,466
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

655
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,051
...where Umbridge won't find out.

656
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,387
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

657
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,515
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

658
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,767
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

659
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,102
Who cares?

660
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:11,566
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

661
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,027
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

662
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,406
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

663
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,866
What's that?

664
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,245
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

665
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:30,084
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

666
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,087
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

667
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:37,091
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

668
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,093
Will do, Harry.

669
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,939
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

670
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,735
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

671
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,404
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

672
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,361
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

673
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,654
The what?

674
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,240
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

675
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,827
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

676
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,663
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

677
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,583
So say you really needed the toilet...

678
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:58,589
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

679

Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,767
Thanks, Ronald.

01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,650

I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,053
It was completely intentional.

Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

Believing in yourself.

01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,384
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

717
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,135
Think of it this way.

01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:17,306
Every great wizard in history

01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,519
...as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

Great, great work.

See you in the Common Room, Harry.

- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,380
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

741
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,013
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

742
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,599
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

743
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,435
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

744
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,104
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

745
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:44,787
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

746
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,331
Yeah. I'm okay.

747
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,835
Anyway, it's worth it.

748
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,343
It's just, learning all this...

749
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,597
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

750
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:06,475
Cedric did know this stuff.

751
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,478
He was really good.

752
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,815
It's just, Voldemort was better.

753
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,154
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

754
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:23,325
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

755
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,170
Mistletoe.

756
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,592
Probably full of Nargles, though.

757
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,344
What are Nargles?

758
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,805
No idea.

759
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:09,038
Well, how was it?

760
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,540
Wet.

761
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,709
I mean, she was sort of crying.

762
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:16,045
That bad at it, are you?

763
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,964
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

764
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,969
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

765
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,388
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

766
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,726
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

767
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,609
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

768
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,862
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

769
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:45,240
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

770
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:49,161
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

771
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,667
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

772
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:58,087
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

773
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,604
Harry.

774
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,449
Voldemort may be after something.

775
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,120
Something he didn't have last time.

776
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,205
Harry.

777
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,083
Harry.

778
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:10,617
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

779
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,286
...or looking down at the scene?

780
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,706
Neither. It was like I...

781
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,375
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

782
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,878
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty
tonight.

783
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,422
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

784
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,215
- Sir.
- Phineas.

785
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,676
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

786
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,471
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

787
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:34,808
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

788
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:38,062
They've got him, Albus. It was close,
but they think he'll make it.

789
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,689
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

790
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,816
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

791
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,193
Look at me!

792
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,910
What's happening to me?

793
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,669
You wished to see me, headmaster?

794
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:07,758
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

795
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,053
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

796
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,434
It appears there's a connection...

797
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,937
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

798
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:24,274
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

799
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:27,653
Pray he remains ignorant.

800
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,115
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

801
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:35,953
...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

802
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,996
...unhinge it.

803
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:41,542
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

804
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,961
...to invade the minds of his victims...

805
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,714
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

806
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:53,637
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

807
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:58,100
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

808
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,435
...kill them.

809
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,855
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

810
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:06,567
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

811
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:11,488
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

812
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:15,159
You will attempt to resist.

813
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,910
Prepare yourself.

814
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:20,873
Legilimens.

815
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,593
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

816
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:00,120
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

817
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,999
Here we go.

That's it. Now, presents.

- Big box for you. And...

- Yes.

823
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,689
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

824
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:32,194
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

825
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,239
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

826
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,407
Oh, Harry, Harry.

827
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:39,493
There you are.

828
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,329
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

829
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,748
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

830
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,917
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

831
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,794
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

832
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,337
Fred? George?

833
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,048

- A Christmas toast.

01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,815
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

840
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:16,071
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

841
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,366
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

842
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,368
No more than usual, Ron.

843
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,412
I don't know why...

844

as bold as brass.

and blood-traitors alike.

847
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,142
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

848
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,145
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

849
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,314
Of course, master.

850
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:55,152
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

851
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,364
Sorry about that.

852
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:03,618
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

853
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,038
Not to me, anyway.

854
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,832
What, you grew up here?

855
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,251
This is my parents' house.

856
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:15,422
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

857
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:19,843
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

858
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,597
This is the Black family tree.

859
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,641
My deranged cousin.

860
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,519
I hated the lot of them.

861
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:34,399
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

862
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:41,406
My mother did that after I ran away.

863
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,619
Charming woman.

864
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,538
I was 16.

865
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,791
Where did you go?

866
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,127
Round your dad's.

867
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:58,173
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

868
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:01,802
I see him so much in you, Harry.

869
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,638
You are so very much alike.

870
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:07,557
I'm not so sure.

871
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,060
Sirius, when I was...

872
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:17,401
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

873
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,070
I was the snake.

874
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:23,865
And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office...

875
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:28,245
...there was a moment
when I wanted to...

876
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,253
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

877
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,507
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

878
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:46,763
I just feel so angry all the time.

879
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:51,476
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

880
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:55,230
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

881
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:01,111
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

882
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,282
You're not a bad person.

883
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:10,454
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

884
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,164
You understand?

885
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:19,337
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

886
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:23,967
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

887
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,971
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

888
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,225
That's who we really are.

889
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,731
Harry, time to go.

890
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:43,779
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

891
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,530
You'll see.

892
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,033
Come on.

893
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,655
Really?

894
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,449
Harry. Harry.

895
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,535
Hagrid's back.

896
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,331
I'm sorry.

897
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:53,723
I will say this one last time.

898
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,393
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

899
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,563
I told you. I've been away
for me health.

900
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:04,067
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

901
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:09,072
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

902
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,618
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

903
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:17,080
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

904
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:39,102
This is top-secret, right?

905
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,397
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

906
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,065
Giants?

907
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,318
You found them?

908
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:50,322
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

909
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:54,284
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

910
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:57,120
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

911
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,748
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

912
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:03,543
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

913
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,421
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

914
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:10,675
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

915
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,555
And they did this to you?

916
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,058
Not exactly, no.

917
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:22,479
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

918
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,578
It's changing out there.

919
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:40,580
Just like last time.

920
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,667
There's a storm coming, Harry.

921
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:47,504
We'd all best be ready when she does.

922
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,544
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

923
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:30,547
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

924
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:34,384
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

925
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,636
We strongly suspect...

926
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,472
...that the breakout was engineered...

927
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:43,852
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

928
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:48,231
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

929
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:54,070
...cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.

930
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,666
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

931
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:10,003
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

932
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,296
Harry.

933
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,010
I wanted to apologize.

934
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:21,765
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

935
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:27,854
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

936
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,404
Neville?

937
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:51,127
Fourteen years ago...

938
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:55,548
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

939
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:58,927
...used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.

940
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:03,473
She tortured them for information...

941
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,809
...but they never gave in.

942
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:09,979
I'm quite proud to be their son.

943
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:14,776
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

944
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,869
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

945
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:32,794
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

946
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:36,422
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

947
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:38,007
George, your turn now.

948
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:41,678
Expecto Patronum.

949
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:46,015
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

950
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:50,019
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

951
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:51,437
Wow, that was really good.

952
01:25:52,146 --> 01:25:53,690
Fantastic, Ginny.

953
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:57,902
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

954
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:00,363
So focus, Luna.

955
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,785
Think of the happiest thing you can.

956
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:07,912
Expecto Patronum.

957
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,957
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

958
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:15,378
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

959
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,506
Expecto Patronum.

960
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,926
I'll make short work of this.

961
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,262
Bombarda Maxima.

962
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,907
Get them.

963
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:27,784
Been watching them for weeks.

964
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,911
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

965
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:33,998
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

966
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,460
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

967
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,170
...never fooled us for a minute.

968
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,422
We saw your lies for what they were:

969
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:45,343
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

970
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:46,594
Naturally.

971
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,305
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

972
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:53,142
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

973
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:58,147
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

974
01:27:58,314 --> 01:28:00,942
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

975
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:04,570
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

976
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:06,572
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

977
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:09,283
If we hurry, we should still make
the morning edition.

978
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:14,247
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

979
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,832
...to Azkaban...

980
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:22,213
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

981
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:25,341
I thought we might hit this little snag.

982
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:29,971
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

983
01:28:30,513 --> 01:28:31,973
What was the phrase?

984
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,725
- Come quietly.

985
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:35,601
Well, I can tell you this:

986
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,354
I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.

987
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:39,772
Enough of this.

988
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,357
Take him.

989
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:58,583
Well, you may not like him, minister...

990
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,877
...but you can't deny...

991
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:04,172
...Dumbledore has got style.

992
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:32,909
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

993
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:36,496
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

994
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:41,709
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

995
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:46,172
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

996
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:58,995
Harry.

997
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:09,338
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

998
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:11,841
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

999
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:14,927
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

1000
01:31:15,094 --> 01:31:17,180
Yeah, we talked you into it.

1001
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:19,348
Yeah, but I agreed.

1002
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:24,020
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

1003
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:28,524
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

1004
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:33,779
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

1005
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:36,616
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

1006
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:39,952
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

1007
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,123
To go it alone.

1008
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,131
Hagrid.

1009
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:58,262
Any idea where he's taking us?

1010
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:01,557
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

1011
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,527
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

1012
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:15,238
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

1013
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,533
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

1014
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,910
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

1015
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,745
Hagrid, what's going on?

1016
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,122
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

1017
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:30,253
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

1018
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,090
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

1019
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:37,760
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

1020
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,599
Grawpy.

1021
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,104
Down here, you great buffoon.

01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:02,744
But I must not tell lies.

1196
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:03,954
What are you doing?

1197
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:07,874
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1198
01:49:08,416 --> 01:49:10,585
Let me go!

1199
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:15,090
Thank you, Grawp.

1200
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:18,760
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1201
01:49:27,018 --> 01:49:30,605
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1202
01:49:30,772 --> 01:49:32,899
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1203
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:35,610
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1204
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:37,946
That was clever, Ron.

1205
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:41,241
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1206
01:49:41,449 --> 01:49:43,285
So how are we getting to London?

1207
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:48,164
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1208
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:51,710
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1209
01:49:51,876 --> 01:49:54,838
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1210
01:49:55,171 --> 01:49:57,299
Or was that all just words to you?

1211
01:49:59,175 --> 01:50:02,387
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1212
01:50:07,309 --> 01:50:09,436
So how are we going to get to London?

1213
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:13,106
We fly, of course.

1214
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:06,326
Department of Mysteries.

1215
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:16,878
This is it.

1216
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:12,142
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1217
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:15,270
Ninety-four.

1218
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:17,522
Ninety-five.

1219
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:32,871
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1220
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,833
It's got your name on it.

1221
01:53:02,066 --> 01:53:06,446
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1222
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,657
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1223
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:12,660
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1224
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:23,671
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1225
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:27,258
Harry.

1226
01:53:37,769 --> 01:53:39,270
Where's Sirius?

1227
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:44,484
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1228
01:53:47,445 --> 01:53:49,572
...and reality.

1229
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:55,828
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1230
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:58,039
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1231
01:53:58,206 --> 01:54:00,291
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1232
01:54:03,044 --> 01:54:05,588
He knows how to play.

1233
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:09,551
Itty, bitty baby.

1234
01:54:09,759 --> 01:54:11,010
Potter.

1235
01:54:11,553 --> 01:54:13,429
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1236
01:54:13,596 --> 01:54:16,558
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1237
01:54:16,724 --> 01:54:18,560
Better, now they're
about to be avenged.

1238
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:26,192
Now, let's everybody
just calm down...

1239
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,194
...shall we?

1240
01:54:28,361 --> 01:54:30,822
All we want is that prophecy.

1241
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:33,199
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1242
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:34,993
You dare speak his name?

1243
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:38,121
You filthy half-blood!

1244
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:40,915
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1245
01:54:42,834 --> 01:54:48,298
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1246
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:51,217
Which is lucky for you, really.

1247
01:54:54,971 --> 01:54:56,931
Haven't you always wondered...

1248
01:54:57,432 --> 01:55:02,562
...the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1249
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:05,815
Why he was unable to kill you...

1250
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:08,568
...when you were just an infant?

1251
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:14,782
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1252
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:20,121
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1253
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:23,291
All you have to do...

1254
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:25,835
...is give it to me.

1255
01:55:26,127 --> 01:55:29,422
Then I can show you everything.

1256
01:55:38,139 --> 01:55:39,974
I've waited 14 years.

1257
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:41,809
I know.

1258
01:55:43,144 --> 01:55:46,105
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1259
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:47,690
Stupefy.

1260
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:04,832
Levicorpus.

1261
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:13,424
Petrificus Totalus.

1262
01:56:13,591 --> 01:56:15,343
Well done, Neville.

1263
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:25,353
Stupefy.

1264
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:28,356
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1265
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:41,369
Stupefy.

1266
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,212
Reducto.

1267
01:57:07,228 --> 01:57:09,397
Get back to the door.

1268
01:57:44,682 --> 01:57:49,145
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1269
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,319
The voices.

1270
01:57:56,861 --> 01:57:58,863
Can you tell what they're saying?

1271
01:58:00,573 --> 01:58:02,700
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1272
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:05,244
Let's get out of here.

1273
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:06,996
I hear them too.

1274
01:58:10,124 --> 01:58:12,752
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1275
01:58:15,463 --> 01:58:16,881
Please, Harry.

1276
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:19,550
Get behind me.

1277
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:08,808
Did you actually believe...

1278
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:13,521
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1279
01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:19,318
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1280
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:26,534
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1281
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:33,541
Give me the prophecy now...

1282
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:37,712
...or watch your friends die.

1283
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:52,101
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1284
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:21,130
Get away from my godson.

1285
02:00:51,243 --> 02:00:53,788
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1286
02:00:54,163 --> 02:00:55,998
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1287
02:00:56,165 --> 02:00:59,001
You've done beautifully.

1288
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:01,295
Now, let me take it from here.

1289
02:01:01,462 --> 02:01:02,463
Black.

1290
02:01:29,657 --> 02:01:30,992
Expelliarmus!

1291
02:01:31,158 --> 02:01:32,493
Nice one, James.

1292
02:01:39,709 --> 02:01:41,210
Avada Kedavra.

1293
02:02:01,397 --> 02:02:03,691
No. No.

1294
02:02:27,757 --> 02:02:30,301
I killed Sirius Black.

1295
02:02:31,302 --> 02:02:33,262
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1296
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:48,778
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1297
02:02:48,944 --> 02:02:52,698
She killed him. She deserves it.

1298
02:02:56,535 --> 02:02:59,747
You know the spell, Harry.

1299
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:12,927
Do it.

1300
02:03:20,601 --> 02:03:23,562
So weak.

1301
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:33,531
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1302
02:03:33,697 --> 02:03:35,449
The Aurors are on their way.

1303
02:03:35,616 --> 02:03:39,829
By which time I shall be gone,
and you...

1304
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,457
...shall be dead.

1305
02:05:57,758 --> 02:05:59,635
You've lost, old man.

1306
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,781
Harry.

1307
02:06:24,952 --> 02:06:26,453
So weak.

1308
02:06:26,954 --> 02:06:29,164
So vulnerable.

1309
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,461
Look at me.

1310
02:06:37,006 --> 02:06:41,260
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1311
02:06:41,427 --> 02:06:43,887
It's how you are not.

1312
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:50,352
Harry?

1313
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:24,219
You're the weak one...

1314
02:07:24,845 --> 02:07:28,974
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1315
02:07:32,394 --> 02:07:35,272
And I feel sorry for you.

1316
02:07:58,337 --> 02:08:01,799
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1317
02:08:02,758 --> 02:08:07,888
And you will lose everything.

1318
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:24,488
He's back.

1319
02:09:29,052 --> 02:09:30,679
DUMBLEDORE:
Harry.

1320
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:34,308
Come in.

1321
02:09:36,018 --> 02:09:37,728
Come on.

1322
02:09:37,728 --> 02:09:39,396
I know how you feel, Harry.

1323
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,106
No, you don't.

1324
02:09:46,737 --> 02:09:48,113
It's my fault.

1325
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:51,575
No, the fault is mine.

1326
02:09:52,576 --> 02:09:54,328
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1327
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:57,581
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1328
02:09:58,373 --> 02:10:02,628
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1329
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:08,008
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1330
02:10:10,844 --> 02:10:14,181
The prophecy said:

1331
02:10:14,806 --> 02:10:18,727
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1332
02:10:20,103 --> 02:10:26,151
It means one of us is gonna
have to kill the other, in the end.

1333
02:10:28,153 --> 02:10:29,738
Yes.

1334
02:10:30,197 --> 02:10:31,782
Why didn't you tell me?

1335
02:10:31,949 --> 02:10:35,536
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1336
02:10:35,702 --> 02:10:38,163
The same reason your friends saved you.

1337
02:10:38,997 --> 02:10:42,501
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1338
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:45,587
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1339
02:10:47,047 --> 02:10:49,174
I cared too much about you.

1340
02:11:10,654 --> 02:11:12,489
The feast is about to start.

1341
02:11:12,489 --> 02:11:15,367
Thanks, Ron.
I'm not really in the mood.

1342
02:11:17,661 --> 02:11:19,997
You know, I'm not hungry either. I --

1343
02:11:19,997 --> 02:11:22,457
You go on.

1344
02:11:22,457 --> 02:11:24,793
Really. I'll be okay.

1345
02:12:18,347 --> 02:12:20,641
How come you're not at the feast?

1346
02:12:20,849 --> 02:12:25,395
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1347
02:12:25,562 --> 02:12:26,563
That's awful.

1348
02:12:26,772 --> 02:12:28,649
Oh, it's all good fun.

1349
02:12:28,815 --> 02:12:32,235
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1350
02:12:32,444 --> 02:12:34,821
Do you want any help finding them?

1351
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:40,911
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1352
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:50,045
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1353
02:12:50,212 --> 02:12:51,880
That's all right.

1354
02:12:52,047 --> 02:12:54,174
Anyway, my mum always said...

1355
02:12:54,383 --> 02:12:58,220
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1356
02:13:01,473 --> 02:13:04,726
If not always in the way we expect.

1357
02:13:06,228 --> 02:13:08,939
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1358
02:13:44,599 --> 02:13:47,519
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1359
02:13:47,686 --> 02:13:49,396
What's that?

1360
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:52,774
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1361
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:56,028
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1362
02:13:56,194 --> 02:13:57,696
Yeah?

1363
02:13:59,614 --> 02:14:01,908
Something worth fighting for.
