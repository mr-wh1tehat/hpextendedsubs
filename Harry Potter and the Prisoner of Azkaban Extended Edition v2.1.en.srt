1
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,700
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,747
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,477
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,648
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,527
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,516
Harry! Harry!

7
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,685
Harry, open the door!

8
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,902
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,489
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,991
What is it?

11
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,285
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,121
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,498
I will if she does.

14
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,793
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,838
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,965
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,469
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:03,016
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,976
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,437
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,564
Okay.

22
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,820
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,782
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,952
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,538
A bit more.

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,375
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,170
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,258
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,471
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,766
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,768
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?

32
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,271
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,441
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,237
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,115
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,868
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,205
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,500
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,587
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,923
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,093
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,096
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,807
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,897
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,899
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,319
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,699
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,661
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,873
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,750
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,507
Right.

52
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,801
Let me tell you...

53
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,366
Vernon!

54
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,204
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,666
Stop!

56
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,797
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,219
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,305
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,350
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,268
Oh, God.

61
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,229
Marge!

62
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,488
Please!

63
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,324
Marge!

64
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,578
Come back!

65
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,980
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,400
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,987
- Keep away from me.
- You're not allowed to do magic outside school.

68
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,198
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,700
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,202
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,175
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,720
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,850
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,022
What you doing down there?

75
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,942
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?

76
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,820
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,197
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,374
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,293
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,296
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,469
Come on.

82
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,107
Come on. Move on,
move on, move on.

83
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,125
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,544
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,516
- What did you say your name was again?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,188
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,316
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,818
The Leaky Cauldron.
Hey, if you have pea soup...

89
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,780
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,827
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,746
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,457
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,253
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,556
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,476
...seven, six, five...

96
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,937
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,939
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,108
Yes!

99
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,822
Who is that?

100
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,408
That man.

101
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,869
Who is that?

102
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,579
Who is...?

103
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,165
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,002
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,589
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,384
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,471
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,598
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,185
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,187
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,773
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,525
Yeah.

113
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,026
Him I've heard of.

114
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,365
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,534
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,579
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,380
Mind your head.

118
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,220
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,598
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,983
Ernie, you're missing the turn!
You're missing the turn! You're missing the turn!!

121
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,490
AAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!

122
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,992
Look...Ernie...
no hands.

123
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,834
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

124
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,676
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

125
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,680
Mr. Potter, at last.

126
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,394
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

127
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,419
Room 11.

128
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,340
Hedwig.

129
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,343
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

130
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,222
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

131
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,769
As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

132
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,147
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

133
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,277
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

134
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:25,197
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

135
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:30,160
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

136
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,040
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

137
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,793
So that's that...

138
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,838
...and no harm done.

139
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,840
Pea soup?

140
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,134
No, thank you.

141
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,511
- Minister?
- Yes?

142
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,430
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

143
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,183
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

144
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,395
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

145
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,106
...for blowing up their aunts.

146
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,615
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

147
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,242
...was very, very irresponsible.

148
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,246
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

149
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,248
Sirius Black, you mean?

150
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,167
But what's he got to do with me?

151
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:25,299
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

152
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,636
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

153
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,764
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

154
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,934
...of having them brought here for you.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

155
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,066
Hedwig.

156
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,321
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

157
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,074
...wander.

158
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,536
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

159
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,367
Housekeeping.

160
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,039
I'll come back later.

161
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,048
I'm warning you, Hermione.

162
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,927
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

163
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,180
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

164
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,349
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

165
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,060
- Looks like a pig with hair if you ask me.
- That's rich...

166
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,772
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

167
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,357
Right, Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

168
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,151
Harry.

169
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,653
Harry.

170
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,908
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

171
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,453
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

172
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,831
- You know, Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Yeah, along with the dung beetle.

173
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,168
- Not flashing that clipping about again, are you Ron?
- I haven't shown anyone.

174
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,754
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

175
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,339
- The day maid.
- The night maid.

176
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,007
- The Cook.
- That bloke who came to fix the toilet.

177
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,092
And that wizard from Belgium.

178
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,384
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

179
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,553
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you too.

180
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,055
- Now, got everything you need?
- Yep.

181
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,390
- Yes? All of your books?
- Yeah, it's all upstairs.

182
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
- And all of our clothes?
- Everything's there.

183
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,560
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

184
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,604
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

185
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,274
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

186
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,111
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

187
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,906
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

188
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,830
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

189
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,666
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

190
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,169
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

191
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,922
You are in danger.

192
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,050
Grave danger.

193
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,178
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

194
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,390
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

195
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,269
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

196
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,772
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

197
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,774
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

198
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,276
Sorry.

199
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,362
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

200
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,155
...Black lost everything.

201
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,618
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

202
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,954
And in his mind...

203
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,124
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

204
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,044
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

205
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,380
And that is why...

206
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,091
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

207
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,135
To find you.

208
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,221
And kill me.

209
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,850
Harry, I want you to swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

210
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,561
...you won't go looking for Black.

211
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,271
Mr. Weasley...

212
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,442
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

213
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,861
Quick. Quick.

214
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,988
Ron, Ron!

215
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,782
Oh, for goodness' sake!

216
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,452
Don't lose him!

217
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,580
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

218
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,208
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

219
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,961
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

220
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,880
I think I was lucky not
to be arrested actually.

221
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,090
I still think it was brilliant.

222
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,010
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

223
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,222
Who do you think that is?

224
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,267
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

225
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,561
How is it she knows everything?

226
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,856
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

227
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,443
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

228
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,280
I've gotta tell you something.

229
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,838
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

230
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,840
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

231
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,009
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

232
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,887
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

233
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,391
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

234
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,561
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

235
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,648
Why are we stopping?

236
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,442
We can't be there yet.

237
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,907
What's going on?

238
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,785
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

239
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,039
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

240
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,834
There's something moving out there.

241
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,475
I think someone's coming aboard.

242
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,545
Bloody hell! What's happening?

243
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,573
HARRY!

244
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,244
Harry.

245
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,163
Harry, are you all right?

246
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,004
Thank you.

247
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,633
Here, eat this. It'll help.

248
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,261
It's all right. It's chocolate.

249
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,644
What was that thing that came?

250
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,231
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

251
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,109
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

252
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,904
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

253
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,412
Eat. You'll feel better.

254
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
What happened to me?

255
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,462
Well, you sort of went rigid.

256
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,799
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

257
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,344
And did either of you two...

258
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,846
...you know...

259
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,099
...pass out?
- No.

260
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,976
I felt weird, though.

261
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,978
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

262
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,440
But someone was screaming.

263
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,983
A woman.

264
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,944
No one was screaming, Harry.

265
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,088
In the cauldron boil and bake,
Fillet of a fenny snake,

266
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:14,387
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witches mummy, maw and gulf.

267
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:26,900
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

268
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,405
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn and cauldron bubble!

269
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:40,121
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn and cauldron bubble!

270
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,083
Something wicked this way comes!

271
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,882
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

272
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,134
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

273
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:57,639
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

274
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,059
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

275
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,687
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

276
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,356
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

277
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,067
Good luck, professor.

278
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,992
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

279
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,828
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

280
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,665
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

281
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,834
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

282
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,378
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher for many years...

283
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,463
...has decided to retire...

284
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,384
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

285
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,304
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

286
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,307
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

287
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,811
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

288
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,867
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

289
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,578
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

290
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:06,958
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

291
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,087
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

292
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,717
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

293
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,552
Now whilst I've been assured...

294
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,389
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

295
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,891
...a word of caution.

296
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,269
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

297
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,856
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

298
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,652
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

299
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,447
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

300
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:43,328
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

301
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,750
But you know,
happiness can be found...

302
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,545
...even in the darkest of times...

303
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,634
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

304
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,648
Fortuna Major.

305
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,153
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

306
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,281
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

307
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,283
Watch this.

308
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:38,007
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

309
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,761
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

310
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,765
She's still doing that after three years.

311
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,101
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

312
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,479
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

313
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,898
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

314
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,026
Green. That's a monkey.

315
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,489
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

316
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,867
Do not give him one again.

317
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,661
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

318
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,503
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

319
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,802
I think we have a winner.

320
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,097
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

321
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,225
Look at him. His face.

322
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,441
Ah! Birdie!
D'oh!

323
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,076
Welcome, my children.

324
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:33,373
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

325
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,836
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

326
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:44,217
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

327
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:49,013
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

328
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,059
This term, we shall be focusing on Tasseomancy,
which is the art of reading tea leaves.

329
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,813
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

330
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,690
What do you see?

331
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:04,529
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

332
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,156
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

333
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:11,869
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

334
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,955
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

335
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,791
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

336
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,252
Is your grandmother quite well?

337
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,379
I think so.

338
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,340
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

339
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,720
Pity.

340
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,556
Broaden your minds.

341
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,479
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

342
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,565
- I think you are.
- Sure.

343
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,984
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

344
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,861
Yeah.

345
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:50,116
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

346
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,203
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

347
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,747
So...

348
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,959
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

349
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,502
Give me the cup.

350
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,965
Oh, my dear boy.

351
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,719
My dear...

352
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,474
...you have the Grim.

353
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,060
The Grin? What's the Grin?

354
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,104
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

355
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,440
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

356
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,109
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

357
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,320
It's an omen...

358
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,322
...of death."

359
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,664
You don't think that Grim thing's got
anything to do with Sirius Black, do you?

360
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,793
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a very woolly discipline.

361
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,630
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

362
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,925
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking this term?

363
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,760
A fair few.

364
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,012
Hang on. That's not possible.

365
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,973
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

366
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,142
You have to be in two
classes at once.

367
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,688
Don't be silly, Ronald. How could
anyone be in two classes at once?

368
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:06,109
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

369
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,239
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

370
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,241
I got a real treat for you today.

371
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,410
A great lesson. So follow me.

372
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,757
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

373
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,427
And open your books to page 49.

374
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,220
Exactly how do we do that?

375
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,307
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

376
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,487
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

377
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,369
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

378
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,038
Really witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

379
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,917
Wait until my Father hears that Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

380
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,211
Shut up, Malfoy.

381
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,770
Dementor! Dementor!

382
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,864
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

383
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,491
Yeah.

384
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,712
Isn't he beautiful?

385
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,507
Say hello to Buckbeak.

386
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,343
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

387
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,595
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

388
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,265
First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs
is that they're very proud creatures.

389
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:05,353
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

390
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,272
It may be the last thing you ever do.

391
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,818
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

392
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,447
Well done, Harry. Well done.

393
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,618
Come on now.

394
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,495
Now...

395
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,415
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

396
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,459
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

397
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,087
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

398
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,381
If he does, you can go and touch him.

399
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,759
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

400
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,472
Just make your bow.

401
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,725
Nice and low.

402
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,732
Back off, Harry. Back off.

403
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,111
Keep still.

404
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,781
Keep still.

405
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:11,377
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

406
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,424
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

407
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,467
Go on. Don't be shy.

408
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,353
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

409
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,108
Not so fast, Harry.

410
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,450
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

411
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,828
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

412
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,041
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

413
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,043
That's it...

414
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,003
Yes!

415
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,007
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

416
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,176
Does he get to fly?

417
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,762
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

418
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,513
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

419
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,850
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

420
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,897
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

421
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,335
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

422
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,462
That was wicked, Harry!

423
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,047
Oh, please.

424
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,175
Well done, well done.

425
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,054
- How'm I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

426
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:15,686
Yes, you're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

427
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,271
Malfoy, no...

428
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,648
No!

429
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,984
Buckbeak!

430
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

431
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,281
Whoa! Buckbeak!

432
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,743
Away, you silly creature...

433
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,038
- It's killin' me! It's killin' me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

434
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,456
Hagrid!

435
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:40,836
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

436
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,759
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

437
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,220
You and your bloody chicken!

438
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,745
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

439
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,791
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

440
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,294
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
or two and I could've lost my arm.

441
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,506
- I couldn't possibly do any homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

442
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:30,010
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

443
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,931
Yeah, but I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

444
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,975
- He's been sighted! He's been sighted!
- Who?

445
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,893
Sirius Black!

446
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,939
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

447
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,984
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

448
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,653
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

449
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,157
He's already slipped past them once, hasn't he?
Who's to say he won't do it again?

450
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:55,911
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

451
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,874
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

452
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,068
Intriguing, isn't it?

453
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,074
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

454
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,035
...as to what is inside?

455
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:40,247
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

456
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,918
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

457
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,170
- No one knows.
- When'd she get here?

458
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,880
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

459
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,300
They take the shape of whatever
a particular person fears the most.

460
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,930
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

461
00:41:56,138 --> 00:42:01,602
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

462
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,732
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

463
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,527
After me. Riddikulus!

464
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,862
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

465
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,573
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

466
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,992
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

467
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,286
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

468
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:23,499
Well, so much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

469
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,419
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

470
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:32,049
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

471
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,345
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

472
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,889
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

473
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,559
Come on.

474
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,521
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

475
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,398
Professor Snape.

476
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,441
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

477
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,028
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

478
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:57,700
- And I believe you live with your grandmother.
- Yes, but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.

479
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,785
No...

480
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,414
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

481
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,875
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

482
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,170
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

483
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:14,216
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

484
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,720
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

485
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,098
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

486
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,017
Can you do that?

487
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,312
Yes. Wand at the ready.

488
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:30,149
One, two, three.

489
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,827
Think, Neville, think.

490
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,623
Riddikulus!

491
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,839
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

492
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,967
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

493
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,516
Form a line!

494
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,103
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

495
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,398
...and turn it into something funny.

496
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,317
Next! Ron!

497
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,074
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

498
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,087
Wand at the ready, Ron. Wand at the ready.

499
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,672
Riddikulus!

500
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,174
Yes!

501
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,677
You see? Very good, very good!

502
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:47,017
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

503
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,021
Show us what you see.

504
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,701
Keep your nerve. Steady.

505
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,828
Riddikulus!

506
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,831
And next! Step up, step up!

507
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,750
Wonderful, wonderful!

508
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,891
Here!

509
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,566
Riddikulus!

510
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,994
Right. Well, sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

511
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,163
If you would all like to collect your
books from the back of the class,

512
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,957
that's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

513
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,169
Sorry, don't want you to have
too much of a good thing.

514
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:01,759
Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

515
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,887
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school in any way...

516
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,973
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

517
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,727
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

518
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,437
That's the rule, Potter.

519
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,857
All those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

520
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,526
But Professor, I thought if you signed it,
then I could go...

521
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,196
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

522
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,574
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

523
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:32,456
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

524
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,919
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

525
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,768
Professor, can I ask you something?

526
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,813
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

527
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,440
I would have thought it'd be obvious.

528
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,443
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

529
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,113
I did think of Voldemort at first.

530
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,950
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

531
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,661
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

532
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,705
That suggests that what you fear
the most is fear itself.

533
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,374
This is very wise.

534
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,626
Before I fainted...

535
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,878
...I heard something.

536
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,047
A woman...

537
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,840
...screaming.

538
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,302
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

539
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,430
Our pain becomes their power.

540
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,475
I think it was my mother...

541
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,853
...the night she was murdered.

542
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:41,942
You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

543
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,362
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

544
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,948
They're your mother, Lily's.

545
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,325
Yes.

546
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,662
Oh, yes. I knew her.

547
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,835
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

548
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,255
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

549
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,758
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

550
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,345
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

551
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:16,685
...even, and perhaps most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

552
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,856
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

553
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,566
...he...

554
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,403
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

555
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:34,202
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

556
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,168
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

557
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,130
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

558
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,763
And the post office. It's about
200 owls sitting on color-coded shelves,

559
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,766
 depending on how fast you want your letter to go.

560
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,768
Honeyduke's Sweet Shop
is brilliant!

561
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,478
But nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

562
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,480
Never did get a chance to go to
the Shrieking Shack though.

563
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,609
- You heard it's the most...
- Most haunted building in Britain. Yeah, I know.

564
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:10,530
But I mean...after a while,
it's a bit boring, don't you think, Ron?

565
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,951
What? No.
Boring?

566
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,162
Oh, yeah.

567
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,413
De...depressing.

568
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:23,293
Oh, hang on! I almost forgot.
I got you something wicked at Dervish & Banges.

569
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,295
It's a pocket sneakoscope.

570
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,299
If there's anyone untrustworthy around,
it's made to light up and spin.

571
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,637
I thought, you know,
it can't hurt...given...

572
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,014
Sirius Black's trying
to kill me.

573
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:39,810
I'm really glad you had a
good time...honestly.

574
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,520
and thanks for this.

575
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,522
You're right. It can't hurt.

576
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,859
Oh...be careful of those.

577
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,529
-They'll make you...
-WHOA!

578
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,947
...nevermind.

579
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,624
What's going on?

580
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,252
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

581
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,838
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

582
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:12,300
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

583
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,595
Get back, all of you.

584
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,932
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been fully searched.

585
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,434
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

586
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,980
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

587
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,065
It's not funny, Ron.

588
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:33,155
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

589
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,537
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

590
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,706
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

591
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,791
You heard. Move!

592
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,892
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

593
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,313
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

594
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,608
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

595
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,569
The Fat Lady's there.

596
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,405
Hey! Mind where you're going!
Slow down!

597
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,658
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

598
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,244
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

599
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,709
Dear lady, who did this to you?

600
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:34,674
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

601
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,595
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

602
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,223
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

603
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,642
Sirius Black!

604
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:48,980
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

605
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:21,972
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery, sir, but there's nothing there.

606
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,724
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

607
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,852
- Very good.
- And I've done the dungeons, Headmaster,

608
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,688
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

609
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,399
I didn't really expect him to linger.

610
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,986
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

611
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,446
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

612
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,283
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

613
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,326
Any theories on how he 
might have managed it?

614
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,496
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

615
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,290
You may recall...

616
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,293
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

617
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,545
...about your appointment
of Professor...

618
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,799
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black to enter it.

619
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,385
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

620
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:04,181
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students back to their houses.

621
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,683
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

622
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,519
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

623
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:15,108
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

624
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,907
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

625
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,181
What villiains are these that
trespass upon my private lands?

626
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,935
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan?

627
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,729
Back, you scurvy braggarts,
you rogues!

628
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,980
He's barking mad!

629
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,733
What'd you expect? After what
happened to the Fat Lady,

630
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,735
none of the other pictures
would take the job.

631
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:03,698
But he keeps changing the password. That's twice
only this morning! I've taken to keeping a list.

632
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:12,248
Farewell, comrades! If ever you have need of noble
heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!

633
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:16,378
Yeah, we'll call you...
if we ever need anyone mental.

634
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:33,061
Turn to page 394.

635
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:46,074
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

636
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,203
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

637
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:54,249
Suffice it to say that your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

638
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:59,504
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

639
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,011
"Werewolves"?

640
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,097
But sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

641
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,475
- We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks.
- Quiet.

642
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,854
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

643
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,983
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

644
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,610
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

645
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,238
No one?

646
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,658
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

647
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,037
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

648
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,747
A werewolf has no choice.

649
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,874
With each full moon...

650
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,919
...when he transforms, he no longer remembers
who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path.

651
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,715
Furthermore, the werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

652
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,635
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That is the second time...

653
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,138
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

654
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,307
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

655
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,810
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

656
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,522
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

657
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:04,319
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

658
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:08,239
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with particular emphasis...

659
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,992
...on recognizing it.
- Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.

660
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,413
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

661
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,667
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

662
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,630
Page 394.

663
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,092
The term "werewolf"...

664
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:32,514
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

665
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:37,685
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

666
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,688
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

667
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,900
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

668
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,069
...being bitten by a werewolf...

669
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:08,508
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

670
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:54,072
HARRY!

671
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,130
Aresto momentum!

672
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,511
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

673
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,972
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

674
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,016
Yeah, c'mon Ron, let's walk you off the
astronomy tower and see what you look like.

675
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,270
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

676
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,901
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

677
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,070
You gave us a right good scare
there, mate.

678
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,824
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

679
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,451
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

680
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,583
Um, no one blames
you, Harry.

681
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,628
The dementors aren't supposed to come
inside the grounds. Dumbledore was furious.

682
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,922
After he saved you,
he sent them straight off.

683
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,759
There's something else
you should know too, Harry.

684
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:03,641
When you fell, your broom, it sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

685
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,643
Well...

686
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,188
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

687
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,150
Is there no chance of fixing it?

688
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,693
No.

689
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,196
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

690
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,700
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

691
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,037
The dementors are amongst the foulest
creatures to walk this earth.

692
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:28,499
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

693
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:33,630
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

694
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,051
You are not weak, Harry.

695
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:42,305
The dementors affect you most of all because
there are true horrors in your past.

696
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,600
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

697
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,353
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

698
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,607
- I'm scared, professor.
- Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

699
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:56,277
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

700
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,446
You made that dementor
on the train go away.

701
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,406
There was only one that night.

702
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:05,286
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

703
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,583
But as the dementors seem
to have developed a particular interest in you...

704
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,420
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

705
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,506
For now, I need to rest.

706
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:46,244
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

707
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,845
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

708
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,931
- But not clever enough.
- Besides, we've got a better way.

709
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,934
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know. Don't worry.

710
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,310
We'll get you there.

711
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,188
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

712
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,942
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

713
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,154
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

714
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,699
What are you doing?!

715
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,785
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

716
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:31,289
- That there is the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me...

717
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,375
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

718
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,294
George, if you will.

719
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,755
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

720
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:46,971
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

721
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:50,349
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

722
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,852
We owe them so much.

723
01:02:56,397 --> 01:03:00,234
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

724
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,862
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

725
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,363
- In his study.
- Pacing.

726
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,491
Does that a lot.

727
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,534
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

728
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,745
- Everyone. Where they are.
- What they're doing.

729
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,038
- Every minute...
- Of every day.

730
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,208
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- Nicked it from Filch's office, of course.

731
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,127
- First year.
- Now listen, there are seven secret passageways...

732
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,963
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

733
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,300
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- It will lead you to straight Honeyduke's cellar.

734
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,302
You best hurry. Filch is heading this way.

735
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,889
Oh, and Harry, don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

736
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:34,393
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

737
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,931
Now, how much do you want?

738
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,148
Delicious.

739
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:33,244
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

740
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,079
Twice.

741
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,124
Do you want to move a bit closer?

742
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,042
To the Shrieking Shack?

743
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,212
Actually, I'm fine here.

744
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,214
Well, well. Look who's here.

745
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,884
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

746
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:52,388
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

747
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,808
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

748
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:01,230
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

749
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,859
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

750
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,028
You filthy little mudblood!

751
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,783
Who is that?

752
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,375
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

753
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,481
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

754
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,861
Get out of the way!

755
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,655
Move!

756
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,116
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

757
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,830
Harry!

758
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:04,043
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

759
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,464
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

760
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:12,093
Harry isn't going to keep it. He'll turn
it over to Professor McGonagall.

761
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:16,305
- Aren't you?
- Oh, sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

762
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,974
Oh, look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

763
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,477
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

764
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,521
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

765
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,064
Allow me, minister.

766
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,108
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

767
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,236
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

768
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:34,323
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

769
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,536
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

770
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,164
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Oh, Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

771
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,959
And what would bring him here?

772
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:49,296
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

773
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,215
Come.

774
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,761
Harry!

775
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:07,940
- I say, no underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

776
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,151
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

777
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,986
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

778
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:15,364
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

779
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:20,036
Nobody will come to a pub where they're
going to get scared out of their wits.

780
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:24,123
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place, I can assure you.

781
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,711
Now, tell me what this is all about.

782
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:33,340
Well now, years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

783
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,177
Do you remember? They went into hiding.
Few knew where they were.

784
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:40,222
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

785
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,642
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who
to the Potters that night...

786
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,188
...but he also killed one of
their friends, Peter Pettigrew!

787
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,607
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

788
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,026
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- I remember him.

789
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,028
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

790
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,947
- But what happened?
- Well, Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters...

791
01:07:57,114 --> 01:08:01,285
...and might have managed to, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

792
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:05,331
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

793
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,708
He destroyed him!

794
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:13,088
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

795
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,300
Oh, yes. Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

796
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,678
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- And now he wants to finish what he started.

797
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,723
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

798
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,685
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

799
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,021
...and remains to this day...

800
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,106
...Harry Potter's godfather!

801
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,034
Ron, look!

802
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,334
- Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry..
- Merry Christmas.

803
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,624
Harry, what happened?

804
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,254
He was their friend...

805
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,007
...and he betrayed them.

806
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,759
He was their friend!

807
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,972
I hope he finds me.

808
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,933
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

809
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,020
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

810
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,911
Harry.

811
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,079
There you are. You came.

812
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:13,334
Now, are you sure about this, Harry?
You know this is very advanced magic...

813
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,961
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

814
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,671
I'm sure.

815
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:20,716
Well, everything's prepared.

816
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:24,345
Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

817
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,013
Did you ever hear of it?

818
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,848
No? Well...

819
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,602
A Patronus is a kind of positive force.
And for the wizard who can conjure one...

820
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:36,440
...it works something like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

821
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:40,444
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

822
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:44,573
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

823
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:48,577
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

824
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,997
Close your eyes.

825
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,668
Concentrate.

826
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,004
Explore your past.

827
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,382
Do you have a memory?

828
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,177
Allow it to fill you up.

829
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,972
Lose yourself within it.

830
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:13,644
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

831
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,897
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

832
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,029
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

833
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,466
Expecto Patronum!

834
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,387
Expecto... Expecto...

835
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,263
Expect...

836
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,598
HARRY!

837
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:56,770
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

838
01:11:56,937 --> 01:12:00,733
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

839
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:06,280
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

840
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,992
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

841
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,953
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

842
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,290
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

843
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,084
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

844
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:22,963
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

845
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,509
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

846
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:39,646
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

847
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,692
Well, it is.

848
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,445
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

849
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,574
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

850
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:57,790
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

851
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,335
Just do it.

852
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:14,640
Expecto Patronum!

853
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,853
Expecto Patronum!

854
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,543
Yes!

855
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,923
Well done, Harry. Well done!

856
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:52,594
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

857
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,180
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

858
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,141
And just so you know, Harry...

859
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:01,311
...I think you would have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

860
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,522
...is saying something.

861
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,693
I was thinking of him.

862
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,028
And Mum.

863
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,448
Seeing their faces.

864
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,784
They were talking to me.

865
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,203
Just talking.

866
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,706
That's the memory I chose.

867
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,793
I don't even know if it's real.

868
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,462
But it's the best I have.

869
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,488
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!

870
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:59,786
That is preposterous, Weasley. How could Sirius Black
possibly get through the portrait hole?

871
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:04,124
I don't know how he got in!
I was a bit busy dodging his knife!

872
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,252
Percy, have you seen Sir Cadogan?

873
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:10,672
I...I...um....oh,
he's there, Professor.

874
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,884
Sir Cadogan? Sir Cadogan?

875
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,638
How may I serve you, ma'am?

876
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:24,853
Excuse me. Is it possible that you let a
mysterious man into Gryffindor Tower tonight?

877
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,734
Certainly, good lady! He had the password.
Checkmate!

878
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:35,405
He had the whole week's in fact...
on the little piece of paper!

879
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:43,247
Which abysmally foolish person wrote down the
passwords and then proceeded to lose them!

880
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:46,458
Is it always going to be you, Longbottom?

881
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,293
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

882
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:53,215
Well, Sirius Black is gone tonight.

883
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:59,721
But, I think you can all safely assume that he will,
at some future time, attempt to return.

884
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:05,727
Now I speak for the entire staff when I say while we take
every precaution to ensure your safety,

885
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:10,274
it is incumbent upon yourselves
to act responsibly.

886
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,985
Understood?
Very well then.

887
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:16,947
Off you go.
And remember, act responsibly.

888
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,953
And this bloody cat ate my rat!

889
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,956
- That's a lie!
- It is not and you bloody well know it!

890
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,341
- I can't believe it.
- I could have killed him.

891
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:41,805
He was right there.
He was close enough to touch.

892
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,766
I could have killed him.

893
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,023
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

894
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,191
Unless, of course, you've been
ripped to pieces!

895
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:55,777
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

896
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,114
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

897
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,408
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

898
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,911
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

899
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:08,999
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

900
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,044
Well, maybe you should learn to
take better care of your pets!

901
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,296
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

902
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,964
- Did.
- Didn't.

903
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,636
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

904
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:24,097
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

905
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:26,933
...talking about why we were there.

906
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,480
And then I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

907
01:17:31,646 --> 01:17:34,608
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

908
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,861
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

909
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:41,239
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

910
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:44,451
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

911
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,453
And then?

912
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,873
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

913
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:54,169
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

914
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,257
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

915
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:31,665
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

916
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,418
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders, Ron.

917
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:38,588
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

918
01:18:56,731 --> 01:18:58,900
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

919
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:02,195
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

920
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,865
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

921
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:16,418
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

922
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:03,798
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

923
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:14,601
Mischief managed. Nox.

924
01:20:16,811 --> 01:20:18,146
Potter.

925
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:21,817
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

926
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,151
I was sleepwalking.

927
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,862
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

928
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:30,784
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

929
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:35,330
My dad didn't strut.
And nor do I.

930
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,167
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

931
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,589
Turn out your pockets.

932
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:48,885
Turn out your pockets!

933
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:53,473
What's this?

934
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,893
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

935
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,112
Reveal your secrets.

936
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,409
Read it.

937
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:20,375
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

938
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,671
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

939
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,423
Go on.

940
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:31,469
"And request that he keep his abnormally
large nose out of other people's business."

941
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,222
- Why you insolent little...
- Professor!

942
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,560
Well, well. Lupin.

943
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:43,481
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

944
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,235
Harry, are you all right?

945
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,904
That remains to be seen.

946
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:54,534
I have just now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter.

947
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:58,204
Take a look, Lupin.
It's supposed to be your area of expertise.

948
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:03,209
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

949
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:06,880
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

950
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:10,884
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

951
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:15,305
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

952
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,600
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

953
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:22,145
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

954
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:30,904
Are you deaf?
Put that light out!

955
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,452
Come in.

956
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:44,417
Now, I haven't the faintest idea, Harry, how
this map came to be in your possession...

957
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:49,089
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

958
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:52,926
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

959
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,095
...is a map to you?

960
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,431
- No.
- No, sir.

961
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:03,436
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

962
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,941
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

963
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:12,654
And gambling their sacrifice by wandering
around the castle unprotected...

964
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:17,325
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

965
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,661
Now, I will not cover up
for you again, Harry.

966
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:22,288
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

967
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:26,126
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

968
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:31,047
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

969
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,140
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

970
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:45,979
Earlier on, it showed someone in the
castle, someone I know to be dead.

971
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,190
Oh, really? And who might that be?

972
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,900
Peter Pettigrew.

973
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,572
That's not possible.

974
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,450
It's just what I saw.

975
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,037
Good night, professor.

976
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:10,670
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

977
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:16,301
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

978
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,804
Only then can you see.
Try again.

979
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,390
Now, what do we have here?

980
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,978
Do you mind me trying?

981
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,317
The Grim, possibly.

982
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:38,573
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

983
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:42,535
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

984
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:46,623
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

985
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:50,460
You may be young in years, but the heart
that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled...

986
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:54,631
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

987
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:57,926
...to which you so desperately cleave.

988
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,443
Have I said something?

989
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:25,119
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean, not that she wasn't always mental...

990
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:27,872
...but now it's out in the open
for everyone to see.

991
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,208
Hang on.

992
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,294
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

993
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:37,090
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

994
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:20,091
Harry Potter...

995
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:31,227
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

996
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,062
Sorry?

997
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:37,901
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

998
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:40,111
...shall break free.

999
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,488
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

1000
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:48,703
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

1001
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,296
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

1002
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:00,882
No.

1003
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,884
Nothing.

1004
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:59,524
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

1005
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,443
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

1006
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:06,739
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' common room.

1007
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,409
This is going to be rich.

1008
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,744
- Look who's here.
- Ah, come to see the show?

1009
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:15,039
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1010
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,958
Hermione, no!

1011
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,794
He's not worth it.

1012
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:35,977
Malfoy, are you okay?

1013
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:40,398
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1014
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:44,944
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1015
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:08,718
Oh, look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

1016
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:11,137
Why don't we just set him free?

1017
01:29:11,345 --> 01:29:13,723
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

1018
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:16,934
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, you know, Dumbledore.

1019
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:19,479
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

1020
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,523
When it happens.

1021
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:23,983
Great man, Dumbledore.

1022
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,569
Great man.

1023
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:32,033
- We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
- You'll do no such thing!

1024
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,369
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

1025
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:39,165
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

1026
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,966
Scabbers! You're alive!

1027
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:52,845
- You want to keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.
- I think that means you owe someone an apology.

1028
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,808
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

1029
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:58,017
I meant me!

1030
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,978
Blimey. What was that?

1031
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:05,483
OWWWW!

1032
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:08,820
Hagrid!

1033
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,073
Oh, crikey.

1034
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,327
No, minister. Over this way.

1035
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,581
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

1036
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:24,544
Someone sees you outside the castle this time of night,
you'll be in trouble...big trouble.

1037
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:28,339
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

1038
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,135
Quick. Quick!

1039
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:34,053
Hagrid.

1040
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:38,141
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

1041
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:42,770
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

1042
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,648
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

1043
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:48,484
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

1044
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:52,572
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

1045
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:57,201
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

1046
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,788
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

1047
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:05,543
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

1048
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,880
...of Dangerous Creatures that the
hippogriff known as Buckbeak...

1049
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:14,552
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

1050
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,222
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

1051
01:31:18,472 --> 01:31:22,852
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

1052
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,729
What?

1053
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:26,981
I thought I just saw...

1054
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,317
- Nevermind.
- Let's go!

1055
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,699
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

1056
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,705
Oh, no.

1057
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:37,843
He bit me. Scabbers.

1058
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:40,388
Ron. Ron!

1059
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:44,850
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

1060
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,104
Wait!

1061
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:58,364
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1062
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,825
That's not good.
Ron, run!

1063
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,455
Harry, Hermione, run!

1064
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,708
It's the Grim!

1065
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:18,718
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1066
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,928
Harry!

1067
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:24,890
- Help!
- Ron!

1068
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:30,313
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1069
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,121
Come on!

1070
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:50,458
Move!

1071
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:56,255
Duck!

1072
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,460
Harry!

1073
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:53,354
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1074
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:57,400
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1075
01:34:57,983 --> 01:34:59,443
I just hope I'm wrong.

1076
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:22,341
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1077
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:25,052
Come on.

1078
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,772
Ron.

1079
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:39,942
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1080
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:43,362
Harry, it's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1081
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,045
If you want to kill Harry,
you'll have to kill us too!

1082
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,047
No. Only one will die tonight.

1083
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,133
Then it'll be you!

1084
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:12,516
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1085
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:15,561
Expelliarmus!

1086
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:23,444
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1087
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:26,697
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1088
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:30,910
Well, you'd know all about the
madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?

1089
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:42,379
- I found him.
- I know.

1090
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:43,839
- It's him.
- I understand.

1091
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,218
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1092
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:51,430
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1093
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:55,142
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1094
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:59,688
How long have you known?

1095
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:03,359
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, well, well, Hermione.

1096
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:06,529
You really are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1097
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:09,073
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1098
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:11,909
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1099
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,495
Twelve years of it!

1100
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,540
In Azkaban!

1101
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:28,717
Very well. Kill him.

1102
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:33,055
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1103
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,807
I know why.

1104
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:37,268
You betrayed my parents.

1105
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:40,396
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, Harry, it wasn't him.

1106
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,439
Somebody did betray your parents...

1107
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:46,151
...but it was somebody who, until
quite recently, I believed to be dead!

1108
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,780
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1109
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:53,075
And he's in this room! Right now!

1110
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:56,537
Come out, come out, Peter!

1111
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:59,748
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1112
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,170
Vengeance is sweet.

1113
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,590
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1114
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:09,091
Severus...

1115
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:14,013
I told Dumbledore you were helping an old
friend into the castle. And now, here's the proof.

1116
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,514
Brilliant, Snape.

1117
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:20,102
You've again put your keen and penetrating mind
to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion.

1118
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,980
Now, if you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have some unfinished business...

1119
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:28,110
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1120
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:30,863
- Severus, don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1121
01:38:31,113 --> 01:38:32,656
- Sirius, be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself, Remus!

1122
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,867
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1123
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,369
Why don't you run along and
play with your chemistry set!

1124
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:40,998
I could do it, you know.

1125
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:47,087
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1126
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,965
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1127
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:53,677
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like to endure.

1128
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:59,266
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1129
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,685
Severus, please.

1130
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,730
After you.

1131
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:10,903
Expelliarmus!

1132
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:16,283
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1133
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:19,036
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
- He was at school with us.

1134
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:20,871
We thought he was our friend!

1135
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:24,083
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1136
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:27,419
I thought so too, until you mentioned
seeing Pettigrew on the map!

1137
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,422
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1138
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,593
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1139
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:39,640
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1140
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:43,060
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1141
01:39:43,268 --> 01:39:45,729
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1142
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,482
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1143
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:51,610
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1144
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:55,114
The dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1145
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,283
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1146
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:03,997
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1147
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,207
Scabbers!

1148
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:08,502
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1149
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:32,776
Remus?

1150
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,029
Sirius.

1151
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:37,114
My old friends!

1152
01:40:42,786 --> 01:40:46,582
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1153
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:50,419
- Like James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1154
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:53,881
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1155
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:59,303
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?
- I didn't mean to!

1156
01:40:59,511 --> 01:41:02,347
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1157
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:05,142
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1158
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:11,148
- What would you have done?
- I would have died! I would have died rather than betray my friends!

1159
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,694
Harry, James wouldn't have
wanted me killed!

1160
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:21,575
Your dad, your dad would spare me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1161
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:26,205
You should have realized, Peter, that if
Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would. Together!

1162
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:28,499
No!

1163
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,921
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1164
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:36,006
But we'll take him to the castle.

1165
01:41:36,215 --> 01:41:41,220
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1166
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:44,807
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1167
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:47,392
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1168
01:41:51,313 --> 01:41:55,067
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1169
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:58,737
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1170
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,489
I was going for the rat.

1171
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:04,493
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1172
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:09,873
In fact, more than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1173
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:14,962
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1174
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:28,976
Okay.

1175
01:42:34,022 --> 01:42:36,525
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1176
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,110
It's fine. I'll stay.

1177
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:40,863
You go, I'll stay.

1178
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:44,283
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1179
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:48,912
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1180
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:51,623
They might chop it.

1181
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,793
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1182
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,172
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1183
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:02,217
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1184
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:06,805
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1185
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:10,726
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1186
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,689
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1187
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:18,609
He doesn't deserve it.

1188
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:21,987
Well, I just didn't think my dad
would have wanted his two best friends...

1189
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:23,697
...to become killers.

1190
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:27,534
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1191
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:30,078
Alive, you're free.

1192
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:33,373
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1193
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:36,919
Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1194
01:43:37,085 --> 01:43:39,546
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1195
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:43,800
- Oh sweet girl, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1196
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:48,138
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1197
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:52,392
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1198
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,561
I know.

1199
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:59,775
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1200
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:02,402
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1201
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:05,072
What? Come and live with you?

1202
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:09,576
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1203
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,328
Harry!

1204
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,389
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1205
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:37,104
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! This heart, here!

1206
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:40,399
This flesh is only flesh!

1207
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:43,652
Expelliarmus!

1208
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,330
Harry!

1209
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:59,334
Remus! Remus!

1210
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:07,884
Run! Run!

1211
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,980
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1212
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:25,193
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1213
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:27,612
Professor?

1214
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,285
Professor Lupin?

1215
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:44,296
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1216
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:47,215
There you are, Potter!

1217
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,042
Sirius!

1218
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,295
Come back here, Potter!

1219
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:32,529
Sirius!

1220
01:47:33,363 --> 01:47:36,283
No. Sirius!

1221
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,036
Expecto Patronum!

1222
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:36,254
Harry?

1223
01:50:37,172 --> 01:50:39,507
I saw my dad.

1224
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:41,301
What?

1225
01:50:41,509 --> 01:50:43,053
He sent the dementors away.

1226
01:50:43,219 --> 01:50:44,596
I saw him across the lake.

1227
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,431
Listen, Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1228
01:50:46,681 --> 01:50:49,517
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1229
01:50:49,684 --> 01:50:52,145
- You mean they're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1230
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:54,189
Much worse.

1231
01:50:54,397 --> 01:50:56,775
They're going to suck out his soul.

1232
01:50:58,485 --> 01:50:59,861
Headmaster, you've
got to stop them.

1233
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:03,365
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1234
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:05,784
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1235
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:07,327
He's my rat, sir.

1236
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:11,498
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1237
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:15,377
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1238
01:51:15,627 --> 01:51:18,088
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1239
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:23,760
But I'm sorry to say the word of three
13-year-old wizards will convince few others.

1240
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:29,599
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1241
01:51:29,808 --> 01:51:33,561
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1242
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:41,277
Mysterious thing, time.

1243
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:43,780
Powerful...

1244
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:46,825
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1245
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:52,038
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1246
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:54,999
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1247
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:56,960
You must not be seen.

1248
01:51:57,127 --> 01:52:00,755
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1249
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:04,467
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1250
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:06,845
If you succeed tonight...

1251
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:09,848
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1252
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:13,893
Three turns should do it, I think.

1253
01:52:18,773 --> 01:52:20,567
Oh, and by the way.

1254
01:52:20,775 --> 01:52:26,614
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1255
01:52:26,781 --> 01:52:28,825
Good luck.

1256
01:52:29,367 --> 01:52:31,786
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1257
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:34,789
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1258
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:05,445
What just happened?

1259
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:07,906
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1260
01:53:08,072 --> 01:53:09,949
Where were we at 7:30?

1261
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:11,910
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1262
01:53:12,076 --> 01:53:14,412
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1263
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:17,332
Hermione!

1264
01:53:35,558 --> 01:53:38,228
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1265
01:53:40,021 --> 01:53:43,608
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1266
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:46,653
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1267
01:53:46,819 --> 01:53:48,112
That's us.

1268
01:53:48,363 --> 01:53:51,282
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1269
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:52,951
This is not normal.

1270
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:57,622
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1271
01:53:57,789 --> 01:53:59,999
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1272
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:03,503
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1273
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:06,881
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1274
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:10,426
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1275
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:15,932
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1276
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:20,353
Good punch.

1277
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:22,021
Thanks.

1278
01:54:23,064 --> 01:54:24,691
Malfoy's coming.

1279
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:27,944
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1280
01:54:28,444 --> 01:54:31,531
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1281
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:35,577
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1282
01:54:36,995 --> 01:54:39,539
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1283
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:01,227
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1284
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,606
Of course.

1285
01:55:04,772 --> 01:55:06,733
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1286
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:10,987
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1287
01:55:11,362 --> 01:55:12,655
Let's go.

1288
01:55:33,968 --> 01:55:36,095
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1289
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:38,723
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1290
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:41,392
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1291
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:44,812
Scabbers, you're alive!

1292
01:55:44,979 --> 01:55:47,732
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1293
01:55:47,982 --> 01:55:50,902
- Harry, you can't.
- Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents.

1294
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:54,072
- You don't expect me to just sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1295
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:00,620
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1296
01:56:00,828 --> 01:56:03,665
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1297
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:06,668
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time, Harry.

1298
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:09,087
We can't be seen.

1299
01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:14,133
Fudge is coming.

1300
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,095
And we aren't leaving?

1301
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:20,848
Why aren't we leaving?

1302
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:33,361
Are you mad?

1303
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,198
OWWW!

1304
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:40,743
That hurt.

1305
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,245
Sorry.

1306
01:57:03,141 --> 01:57:05,810
C'mon! We're coming out the back door. Go!

1307
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:26,038
- Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
- Hermione!

1308
01:57:28,082 --> 01:57:29,375
What?

1309
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:32,086
I thought I just saw...

1310
01:57:32,336 --> 01:57:35,006
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1311
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:51,606
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1312
01:57:57,862 --> 01:57:59,822
Get away. Get off.

1313
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:25,431
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1314
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:29,435
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1315
01:58:29,644 --> 01:58:33,397
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1316
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:40,571
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1317
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:46,744
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1318
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:50,873
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1319
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:53,000
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1320
01:58:55,711 --> 01:58:58,631
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1321
01:58:58,881 --> 01:59:01,175
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1322
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:08,266
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1323
01:59:08,516 --> 01:59:10,143
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1324
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:13,729
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1325
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:17,441
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1326
01:59:17,608 --> 01:59:20,444
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries, you see.

1327
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:24,240
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1328
01:59:24,448 --> 01:59:25,616
- Over there.
- Where?

1329
01:59:25,783 --> 01:59:27,493
- Over there, look again.
- This way.

1330
01:59:27,743 --> 01:59:30,413
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1331
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:33,791
But where is it?

1332
01:59:34,709 --> 01:59:36,919
I saw the beast, just now.

1333
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:39,755
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1334
01:59:39,922 --> 01:59:41,215
Buckbeak.

1335
01:59:41,465 --> 01:59:45,511
Oh, come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1336
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,013
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1337
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:51,475
I don't think the minister's suggesting
that you had anything to do with this, Hagrid.

1338
01:59:51,726 --> 01:59:54,562
After all, how could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1339
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:56,606
- Right.
- Well, well.

1340
01:59:56,772 --> 01:59:58,316
We must search the grounds.

1341
01:59:58,482 --> 02:00:01,485
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1342
02:00:01,694 --> 02:00:07,116
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1343
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:11,245
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1344
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:13,331
Thank you.

1345
02:00:13,539 --> 02:00:16,792
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1346
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:29,055
- Come on.
- This way.

1347
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:37,688
This way, now.

1348
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:41,817
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1349
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:44,528
- How?
- No idea.

1350
02:00:53,871 --> 02:00:56,207
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1351
02:01:02,672 --> 02:01:04,632
And Snape's coming.

1352
02:01:10,888 --> 02:01:12,515
And now we wait.

1353
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:15,559
And now we wait.

1354
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:46,382
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1355
02:01:49,176 --> 02:01:50,970
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1356
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:55,433
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1357
02:01:55,641 --> 02:01:57,768
...I did see someone.

1358
02:01:57,935 --> 02:02:01,355
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1359
02:02:01,522 --> 02:02:02,815
With a Patronus.

1360
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:04,900
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1361
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:06,569
According to him...

1362
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:10,156
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1363
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:12,199
It was my dad.

1364
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:15,119
It was my dad who
conjured the Patronus.

1365
02:02:15,286 --> 02:02:17,496
- Harry, your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1366
02:02:18,956 --> 02:02:21,250
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1367
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:27,048
Here we come.

1368
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,056
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1369
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:38,100
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1370
02:02:38,267 --> 02:02:41,604
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1371
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:43,397
It'll just be me and him.

1372
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:46,025
We could live in the country...

1373
02:02:46,192 --> 02:02:48,778
...someplace you can see the sky.

1374
02:02:48,986 --> 02:02:51,822
I think he'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1375
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,408
Harry!

1376
02:02:55,951 --> 02:02:57,661
Run! Run!

1377
02:03:04,543 --> 02:03:06,087
Let's go.

1378
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:27,942
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1379
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:33,614
Thanks.

1380
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:39,495
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1381
02:04:54,612 --> 02:04:56,322
That was so scary.

1382
02:04:56,530 --> 02:04:59,450
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1383
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:14,006
Sirius. Come on!

1384
02:05:30,064 --> 02:05:32,191
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1385
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:35,528
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1386
02:05:44,286 --> 02:05:46,080
Any minute now.

1387
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:48,374
Right there. You'll see.

1388
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:52,211
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1389
02:05:52,419 --> 02:05:54,922
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1390
02:05:59,093 --> 02:06:01,512
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1391
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:05,474
...both of you.

1392
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,270
Harry!

1393
02:06:11,188 --> 02:06:15,025
Expecto Patronum!

1394
02:07:13,667 --> 02:07:15,210
You were right, Hermione.

1395
02:07:15,419 --> 02:07:18,756
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1396
02:07:18,922 --> 02:07:21,675
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1397
02:07:21,842 --> 02:07:24,178
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1398
02:07:24,386 --> 02:07:26,096
...well, I had already done it.

1399
02:07:26,263 --> 02:07:28,682
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1400
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:31,727
But I don't like flying...!

1401
02:07:44,865 --> 02:07:46,158
Bombarda!

1402
02:08:19,525 --> 02:08:22,277
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1403
02:08:22,486 --> 02:08:23,779
...to both of you.

1404
02:08:23,987 --> 02:08:26,907
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1405
02:08:27,074 --> 02:08:29,993
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1406
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,870
And besides...

1407
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:36,083
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1408
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:38,419
And you know it.

1409
02:08:39,503 --> 02:08:41,380
And for now, that will do.

1410
02:08:43,716 --> 02:08:46,218
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1411
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,763
...but you look so like your father.

1412
02:08:51,557 --> 02:08:53,517
Except your eyes.

1413
02:08:54,476 --> 02:08:56,770
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1414
02:08:58,730 --> 02:09:03,777
It's cruel that I got to spend so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1415
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:05,863
But know this:

1416
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:10,200
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1417
02:09:11,577 --> 02:09:13,537
And you can always find them...

1418
02:09:15,914 --> 02:09:17,791
...in here.

1419
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:30,679
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1420
02:09:57,539 --> 02:09:59,166
We have to go.

1421
02:10:27,444 --> 02:10:30,113
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1422
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:31,823
Did what?

1423
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:33,951
Good night.

1424
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:44,002
How did you get there?

1425
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:46,880
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1426
02:10:47,214 --> 02:10:49,800
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1427
02:10:50,008 --> 02:10:53,512
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1428
02:11:20,038 --> 02:11:21,498
Hello, Harry.

1429
02:11:25,168 --> 02:11:26,962
I saw you coming.

1430
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:34,219
I've looked worse, believe me.

1431
02:11:36,972 --> 02:11:40,142
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1432
02:11:40,309 --> 02:11:43,228
No. I resigned, actually.

1433
02:11:43,437 --> 02:11:45,230
Resigned? Why?

1434
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:50,652
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1435
02:11:50,861 --> 02:11:56,366
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want a...

1436
02:11:56,533 --> 02:11:59,870
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1437
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:01,997
- But Dumbledore...
- Dumbledore has already...

1438
02:12:02,205 --> 02:12:04,082
...risked enough on my behalf.

1439
02:12:04,249 --> 02:12:07,502
Besides, people like me are...

1440
02:12:08,128 --> 02:12:11,465
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1441
02:12:21,016 --> 02:12:23,560
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1442
02:12:23,769 --> 02:12:25,896
None of it made any difference.

1443
02:12:26,104 --> 02:12:29,608
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1444
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:33,320
Harry, it made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1445
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:35,948
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1446
02:12:36,365 --> 02:12:38,825
It made a great deal of difference.

1447
02:12:43,497 --> 02:12:45,707
If I am proud of anything...

1448
02:12:45,874 --> 02:12:48,543
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1449
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:51,463
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1450
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:55,842
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1451
02:12:56,802 --> 02:12:59,262
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1452
02:12:59,471 --> 02:13:02,015
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1453
02:13:02,599 --> 02:13:03,892
Until then...

1454
02:13:05,268 --> 02:13:06,979
...mischief managed.

1455
02:13:41,221 --> 02:13:45,434
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1456
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,977
Harry.

1457
02:13:47,853 --> 02:13:49,229
Wherever did you get it?

1458
02:13:49,396 --> 02:13:51,773
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1459
02:13:51,982 --> 02:13:54,109
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1460
02:13:54,317 --> 02:13:57,571
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1461
02:13:57,779 --> 02:14:00,240
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1462
02:14:00,449 --> 02:14:01,908
Did not.

1463
02:14:03,326 --> 02:14:06,830
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1464
02:14:06,997 --> 02:14:08,540
For me?

1465
02:14:08,707 --> 02:14:11,209
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1466
02:14:11,418 --> 02:14:13,295
This came with it.

1467
02:14:18,175 --> 02:14:19,801
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1468
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:21,803
How fast is it, Harry?

1469
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:42,824
Lumos.

1470
02:14:42,991 --> 02:14:45,368
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1471
02:26:04,589 --> 02:26:06,382
Mischief managed.

1472
02:26:12,138 --> 02:26:13,598
Nox.
