1
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,404
It's beautiful here.

2
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,115
It was our aunt's.

3
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,534
We used to come here as kids.

4
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,746
The Order uses it
now as a safe house.

5
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,124
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,505
Muggles think these keep
evil away, but they're wrong.

7
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,927
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,065
How are you?

9
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,610
Alive.

10
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,158
You probably don't remember...

11
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,620
That I showed you to your vault the
first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,082
Even amongst goblins
you're famous, Harry Potter.

13
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,545
You buried the elf.

14
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,089
Yes.

15
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,966
And brought me here.

16
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,678
You are...

17
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,932
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,692
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,614
It's complicated.

20
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,412
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,581
It's complicated.

22
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,463
The sword presented itself
to us in a moment of need.

23
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,382
We didn't steal it.

24
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,847
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,640
...but it is a fake.

26
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,475
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,146
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,025
Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,860
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,489
A Hogwarts professor. As I
understand it, he's now headmaster.

31
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,366
Snape?

32
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,037
He put a fake sword
in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,788
Why?

34
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,543
There are more than a few curious
things in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,464
And in Madam Lestrange's
vault as well?

36
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,343
Perhaps.

37
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,182
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,017
This is impossible.

39
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,063
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,652
Why should I help you?

41
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,572
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,784
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,499
That.

44
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,876
That is my price.

45
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:33,101
Are you thinking there's a
Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,770
She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.

47
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,730
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

48
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,900
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.

49
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,986
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,780
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,575
How are we supposed to destroy it now
you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,577
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,206
He's weak.

54
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,259
Yes?

55
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,098
Mr. Ollivander, I need to
ask you a few questions.

56
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,017
Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,563
Would you mind
identifying this wand?

58
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,357
We need to know if
it's safe to use.

59
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,073
Walnut.

60
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
Dragon heartstring.

61
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,955
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,749
Unyie...

63
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,503
Unyielding.

64
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,842
This belonged to
Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,803
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,805
And this?

67
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,102
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,023
And unicorn hair.

69
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,861
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,952
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,164
Was? Is it not still?

72
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:22,502
Well, perhaps not,
if you won it from him.

73
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,507
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,059
You talk about wands as
if they have feelings...

75
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,270
...can think.

76
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,111
The wand chooses the
wizard, Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:54,617
That much has always been clear to
those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,205
And what do you know about
the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,217
The Elder Wand...

80
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:17,223
...the Cloak of Invisibility to
hide you from your enemies...

81
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,229
...and the Resurrection Stone to
bring back loved ones from the dead.

82
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:28,359
Together, they make
one the master of death.

83
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:34,615
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

84
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,450
Do you?

85
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,203
Do you believe they exist, sir?

86
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:49,338
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

87
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,007
You're lying.

88
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,468
You know one exists.

89
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,470
You told him about it.

90
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:02,184
You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.

91
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,773
He tortured me.

92
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,320
Besides...

93
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,990
...I only conveyed rumors.

94
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,285
There's...

95
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,664
There's no telling
whether he will find it.

96
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,586
He has found it, sir.

97
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,260
We'll let you rest.

98
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,182
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

99
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:47,647
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

100
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,150
...I'm afraid...

101
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,653
...you really don't stand a chance.

102
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,408
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill
him before he finds me, then.

103
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,832
Are you sure that's hers?

104
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,169
Positive.

105
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,805
How do we know what it is
when we get in there?

106
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,515
Horcruxes could be anything.

107
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,642
I'll ... I'll know.

108
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,645
How?

109
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,690
I don't know how to explain it.

110
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,525
But I'll know.

111
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,488
This is the closest I could find
to what you described.

112
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,032
It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.

113
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,581
You're leaving, aren't you?

114
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,625
HARRY:
In the morning.

115
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,085
And Griphook?

116
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,753
He's coming with us.

117
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,047
Listen, I know goblins.

118
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:02,430
If you've struck any kind of bargin with Griphook,
you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it.

119
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:08,018
If you don't, he won't be forgiving.

120
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,949
The sky has lost a star.

121
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,704
My father used to say that
when a child died.

122
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,669
Funny how Mr. Dobby knew
exactly where to find us.

123
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,172
Yeah, it's funny.

124
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,513
Hogwarts?

125
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,185
It's not the place you left, you know?

126
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,270
It's not the same.

127
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,732
Neither am I.

128
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,788
Always "good day to you".
I'll miss her.

129
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,625
What do you think?

130
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,045
I wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.

131
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,136
You gonna tell me what that is?

132
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,350
You're going to think I'm mental, but...

133
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,354
...more than once when I've looked into it,
I've seen Dumbledore.

134
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,399
Bloody hell. That's a sight.

135
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,863
Well?

136
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,741
How do I look?

137
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,285
Hideous.

138
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,269
We're relying on you, Griphook.

139
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,439
If you get us past the guards and
into the vault, the sword's yours.

140
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,203
Madam Lestrange.

141
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,163
Good morning.

142
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,002
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

143
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,338
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

144
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,173
Hey. Easy.

145
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,928
She gives us away, we might as well
use that sword to slit our own throats.

146
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,972
Understand?

147
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,642
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

148
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
Okay.

149
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,313
Let's do it.

150
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,838
I wish to enter my vault.

151
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,302
Identification?

152
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,933
I hardly think
that'll be necessary.

153
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,312
Madam Lestrange.

154
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,736
I don't like to be kept waiting.

155
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,905
They know.

156
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,241
They know she's an imposter.

157
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,870
They've been warned.

158
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,463
Harry?

159
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,216
What do we do, Harry?

160
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,642
Madam Lestrange, would you
mind presenting your wand?

161
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,811
And why should I do that?

162
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:06,525
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

163
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,820
No. I most certainly
do not understand.

164
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,824
I'm afraid I must insist.

165
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,039
Imperio.

166
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,716
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

167
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,086
What is that, Griphook?

168
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,843
Griphook.

169
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,323
Arresto momentum.

170
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,328
Well done, Hermione.

171
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,505
Oh, no, you look like you again.

172
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,968
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

173
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,219
Can be deadly.

174
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,054
You don't say.

175
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,224
Just out of interest, is there
any other way out of here?

176
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,059
No.

177
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,939
What the devil are all
you doing down here?

178
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,315
Thieves!

179
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,776
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Imperio.

180
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,039
That doesn't sound good.

181
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,801
Bloody hell.

182
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,469
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

183
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,971
Here.

184
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,985
It's been trained to expect
pain when it hears the noise.

185
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,653
That's barbaric.

186
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,310
Lumos.

187
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,982
Blimey.

188
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,241
Accio Horcrux.

189
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,870
You're not trying that
one again, are you?

190
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,748
That kind of magic
won't work in here.

191
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,963
Is it in here, Harry?

192
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,215
Can you feel anything?

193
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,531
That's it. Up there.

194
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,496
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

195
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,998
Give me the sword.

196
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,684
Stop moving.

197
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,541
Got it.

198
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,754
We had a deal, Griphook.

199
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,297
The cup for the sword.

200
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:31,016
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say
anything about getting you out.

201
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,705
Griphook!

202
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,540
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!

203
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,542
Thieves!

204
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,173
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

205
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,057
That's unfortunate.

206
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,230
We can't just stand here.
Who's got an idea?

207
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,940
You're the brilliant one.

208
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,359
I've got something, but it's mad.

209
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,860
Reducto.

210
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,916
Well, come on, then.

211
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,629
Relashio.

212
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,219
Keep moving! Aah!

213
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,955
Now what?

214
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,457
Reducto.

215
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,126
Hold on.

216
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,556
That was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

217
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,669
We're dropping.

218
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,882
- I say we jump.
-When?

219
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,425
Now.

220
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,816
He knows. You-Know-Who.

221
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,609
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

222
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,946
He knows what we took and he
knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

223
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,906
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

224
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,576
You let him in? Harry,
you can't do that.

225
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,288
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

226
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,165
Never mind. What happened?

227
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,125
Well, he's angry.

228
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,877
And scared too.

229
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,714
He knows if we find and destroy all the
Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

230
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,384
I reckon he'll stop at nothing to
make sure we don't find the rest.

231
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,846
There's more.
One of them's at Hogwarts.

232
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,723
What?

233
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,559
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

234
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,270
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

235
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,774
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

236
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,069
Hermione, when have any of our
plans ever actually worked?

237
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,613
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

238
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,032
He's right.

239
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:43,453
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.

240
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,375
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

241
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,877
Take the secret
passage in the cellar.

242
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,422
It's... There's something
wrong with him.

243
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,927
It's like, you know, in the past, I've
always been able to follow his thoughts.

244
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,971
And now everything
just feels disconnected.

245
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,431
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

246
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,767
Maybe he's growing weaker.
Maybe he's dying.

247
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,895
No. No, it's more
like he's wounded.

248
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,856
If anything,
he feels more dangerous.

249
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:03,366
- They're here!
- Search everywhere!

250
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,077
Look down by the stables!
You two, come with me!

251
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,246
Any sign?

252
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,804
Potter!

253
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,527
In here, Potter.

254
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,001
Did you get a look at him?

255
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,962
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

256
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,939
Harry?

257
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,109
I can see you in this.

258
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,875
You bloody fools. What were
you thinking coming here?

259
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,294
Have you any idea
how dangerous it is?

260
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,131
You're Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.

261
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,592
It's you who I've
been seeing in here.

262
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,928
You're the one who sent Dobby.

263
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,429
Where have you left him?

264
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,139
He's dead.

265
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,767
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

266
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,854
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

267
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,648
Mundungus Fletcher,
about a year ago.

268
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,110
-Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.

269
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,487
Albus told me.

270
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,284
He also told me you'd likely be hacked
off if you ever found out I had it...

271
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,330
...but ask yourself, where
would you be if I didn't?

272
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,003
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

273
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,171
The Order's finished.

274
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,673
You-Know-Who's won.

275
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,260
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

276
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,971
We need to get into
Hogwarts, tonight.

277
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,098
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

278
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,933
Did he now?

279
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,519
Nice job? Easy?

280
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,647
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

281
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,401
We think the last one's inside the
castle, but we'll need help getting in.

282
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,113
That's not a job my brother's
given you. It's a suicide mission.

283
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,658
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

284
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,496
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

285
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,625
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

286
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,378
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

287
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,506
Did he ever mention hers?

288
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,385
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

289
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,848
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

290
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,143
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

291
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,146
...who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

292
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,525
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

293
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,694
That's what a fool does.

294
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,782
You don't strike me
as a fool, Harry Potter.

295
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:35,620
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

296
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,959
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

297
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,920
I don't care that you've given up.

298
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,008
I trusted the man I knew.

299
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,223
And we need to get
into the castle tonight.

300
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,897
You know what to do.

301
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,447
Where have you sent her?

302
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,451
You'll see soon enough.

303
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,460
That's your sister,
Ariana, isn't it?

304
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,131
She died very young, didn't she?

305
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,802
My brother sacrificed
many things, Mr. Potter...

306
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,471
...on his journey to find power...

307
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,932
...including Ariana.

308
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,227
And she was devoted to him.

309
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,272
He gave her everything...

310
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,983
...but time.

311
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,737
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

312
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,121
He did save our lives twice.

313
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,915
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

314
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,211
That doesn't seem like
someone who's given up.

315
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,469
She's coming back.

316
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,346
Who's that with her?

317
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,688
Neville.

318
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,399
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

319
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,152
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

320
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,364
Hey, Ab, we've got a
couple more coming through.

321
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,618
Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.

322
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,703
That's because it never
existed till now.

323
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,123
The seven secret passages were sealed
off before the start of the year.

324
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,875
This is the only way in or out now.

325
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,878
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

326
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,588
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

327
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,841
Hardly ever see him. It's the
Carrows you need to watch out for.

328
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,926
Carrows?

329
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,553
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

330
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,430
They like punishment, the Carrows.

331
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,599
They did that to you? Why?

332
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,436
Today's Dark Arts lessons had us
practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

333
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,522
On first-years.

334
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,524
I refused.

335
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,443
Hogwarts has changed.

336
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,792
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

337
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,842
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

338
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:40,096
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

339
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,058
Blimey.

340
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,561
- Harry!
- Yeah!

341
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,118
Get the word out to Remus and
the others that Harry's back.

342
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,579
Okay, let's not kill him
before You-Know-Who...

343
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,080
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

344
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,292
Lightning has struck.

345
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,127
What's the plan, Harry?

346
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,049
Okay.

347
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,094
There's something we need to find.

348
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:25,266
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

349
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,226
Right. What is it?

350
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,561
We don't know.

351
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,441
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

352
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,029
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

353
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,656
I think it has something
to do with Ravenclaw.

354
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:45,494
Um, it'll be small,
easily concealed.

355
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,497
Anyone, any ideas?

356
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,335
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

357
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,921
Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.

358
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,131
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

359
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,594
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

360
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,139
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

361
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,100
There isn't a person alive
today who's seen it.

362
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,645
Excuse me. Can someone tell
me what a bloody diadem is?

363
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,356
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

364
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,902
Harry.

365
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,488
Hi there.

366
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:26,869
Six months she hasn't seen me and
it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

367
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,704
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

368
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,123
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

369
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,792
What is it, Ginny?

370
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,171
Snape knows. He knows that
Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

371
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,184
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

372
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:32,018
Many of you are surely wondering why
I have summoned you at this hour.

373
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,274
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

374
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,986
...Harry Potter was
sighted in Hogsmeade.

375
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,073
Now...

376
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,825
...should anyone...

377
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:54,749
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

378
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,002
...they will be punished...

379
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,631
...in a matter consistent with the
severity of their transgression.

380
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,051
Furthermore...

381
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:10,097
...any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

382
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,353
...who fails to come forward...

383
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,858
...will be treated as...

384
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,737
...equally guilty.

385
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,866
Now then...

386
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,455
...if anyone here...

387
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:41,087
...has any knowledge of Mr.
Potter's movements this evening...

388
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,218
...I invite them to step forward...

389
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,431
...now.

390
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,991
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

391
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,911
...you still have a bit of a
security problem, headmaster.

392
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,334
And I'm afraid it's
quite extensive.

393
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,170
How dare you stand where he stood?

394
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,882
Tell them how it
happened that night.

395
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,595
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

396
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,639
Tell them.

397
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,540
Coward!

398
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,093
Harry.

399
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,387
Potter?

400
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:53,594
I know that many of you
will want to fight.

401
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:58,807
Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.

402
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,269
But this is folly.

403
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,564
Give me Harry Potter.

404
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:10,694
Do this and none shall be harmed.

405
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:16,909
Give me Harry Potter and I
shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

406
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,037
Give me Harry Potter...

407
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,124
...and you will be rewarded.

408
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,878
You have one hour.

409
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,598
What are you waiting for?

410
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,100
Someone grab him.

411
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,944
Students out of bed.

412
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,030
Students out of bed!

413
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,740
Students in the corridor!

414
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,327
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

415
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,163
Oh.

416
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,790
Sorry, ma'am.

417
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,836
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

418
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,297
If you would,
I would like you, please...

419
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:15,968
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the
rest of Slytherin House from the hall.

420
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,721
Exactly where is it I'll
be leading them to, ma'am?

421
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,473
The dungeons would do.

422
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,270
Right. Come on. Come on.

423
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,940
I presume you have a reason for
returning, Potter. What is it you need?

424
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,484
Time, professor. As much
as you can get me.

425
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,655
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

426
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,116
Potter.

427
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,828
It's good to see you.

428
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,123
It's good to see you too,
professor.

429
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,917
Hold the fort, Neville.

430
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,256
Hurry up, come on!

431
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,973
Harry. Hermione and
I have been thinking.

432
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,100
It doesn't matter if
we find a Horcrux.

433
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,478
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

434
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,937
So we were thinking...

435
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,607
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

436
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,943
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

437
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,321
Me and Hermione know
where we might find one.

438
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,239
Okay.

439
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:23,118
Okay, but take this. That way you
can find me when you get back.

440
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,537
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

441
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,081
Gotta start somewhere.

442
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,880
Harry.

443
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,590
Harry!

444
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,258
Let me get this straight.

445
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:42,388
- You're giving us permission to do this?
- That is correct, Longbottom.

446
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,014
To blow it up? Boom?

447
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,641
Boom!

448
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,228
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

449
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,730
Why don't you confer
with Mr. Finnigan?

450
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,484
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyrotechnics.

451
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,693
I can bring it down.

452
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,196
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

453
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:03,617
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

454
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,787
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

455
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:11,959
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

456
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,045
He's going to try to
kill you either way.

457
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,592
Piertotum Locomotor.

458
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,943
Hogwarts is threatened.

459
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:44,324
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

460
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:51,039
I've always wanted
to use that spell.

461
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,885
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

462
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:07,681
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

463
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:12,603
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

464
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,438
Protego Maxima.

465
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:47,054
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

466
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,015
You won't find anything where
you're going. You're wasting time.

467
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,184
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

468
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,602
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

469
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,687
You listen to me right now!

470
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,609
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

471
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,654
"There's not a person alive who's seen it."

472
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:08,534
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

473
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,713
It's very impressive, isn't it?

474
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,690
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

475
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,316
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

476
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,986
I think it's best if
you two talk alone.

477
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,321
She's very shy.

478
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,391
You're the Grey Lady...

479
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,935
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

480
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,854
I do not answer to that name.

481
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:23,567
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

482
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,861
Rowena's daughter.

483
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,071
Are you a friend of Luna's?

484
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,198
Yes.

485
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,826
And she thought you might
be able to help me.

486
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,331
You seek my mother's diadem.

487
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,542
Yes.

488
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,502
That's right.

489
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,884
Luna is kind, unlike
so many of the others.

490
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,137
But she was wrong.
I cannot help you.

491
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,227
Wait. Please.

492
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,940
I want to destroy it.

493
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,438
They never learn.

494
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,608
Such a pity.

495
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,237
But, my Lord...

496
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,656
...shouldn't we wait for...?

497
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,574
My Lord.

498
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,206
Begin.

499
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,187
That's what you want
too, isn't it, Helena?

500
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,027
You want it destroyed.

501
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,197
Another swore to destroy
it many years ago...

502
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,242
...a strange boy
with a strange name.

503
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,245
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

504
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,621
He's lied to many people.

505
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,875
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

506
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,961
He defiled it with dark magic!

507
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,646
I can destroy it once and for all.

508
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,568
But only if you tell
me where he hid it.

509
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:19,326
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

510
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,330
You just have to tell me.

511
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,583
Please.

512
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,639
Strange.

513
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,603
You remind me of him a bit.

514
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,106
It's here...

515
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:54,027
...in the castle, in the place
where everything is hidden.

516
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,614
If you have to ask...

517
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,117
...you will never know.

518
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:05,038
If you know, you need only ask.

519
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,916
Thank you.

520
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,975
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and
I will handle this side of the castle.

521
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,519
Yes, sir.

522
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,067
Hey, Dean, on second thought,
tell Professor McGonagall...

523
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,028
...we might need one or
two more wands this side.

524
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:42,701
It is the quality of one's convictions
that determines success...

525
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,452
...not the number of followers.

526
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,621
Who said that?

527
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,623
Me.

528
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,215
You shouldn't have.

529
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,717
It's Teddy who needs you.

530
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,803
He'll sleep til dawn and snore like his father.

531
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,265
It's you that needs me tonight.

532
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,563
You okay, Freddie?

533
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,356
Yeah.

534
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,526
Me too.

535
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:37,255
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?

536
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,175
No, of course not.

537
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,333
Seamus!

538
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,419
Seamus!

539
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,215
You do know what you're doin',
don't ya?

540
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,247
Yeah?

541
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,915
You and whose army?

542
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,770
- You do it.
- I can't.

543
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,023
Yes, you can.

544
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,744
Neville!

545
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,846
That went well.

546
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:27,021
Get inside! This way,
everyone. Take cover!

547
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,541
Stupefy!

548
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,377
Get your coat on!

549
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:52,672
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

550
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:57,385
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire.
You haven't seen Luna, have you?

551
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,387
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

552
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,850
I think it's about time I told her since
we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

553
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,606
I know.

554
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,985
Nighty night.

555
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,739
Let us out of here, you flithy squib!

556
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,582
[SLYTHERINS SCREAMING]

557
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,743
Bloody hell. We'll
never find it on this.

558
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,579
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

559
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,999
He just vanished.
Just now. I saw it.

560
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,296
Maybe he's gone to
the Room of Requirement.

561
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,758
It doesn't show up on the map,
does it? You said that last year.

562
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,302
That's right. I... I did.

563
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,137
Let's go.

564
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,598
Brilliant.

565
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,855
Come on!

566
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,093
Well, well.

567
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,138
What brings you here, Potter?

568
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,849
I could ask you the same.

569
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,519
You have something of mine.

570
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,896
I'd like it back.

571
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,607
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It's my mother's.

572
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,486
It's powerful,
but it's not the same.

573
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,281
Doesn't quite understand me.

574
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,283
Know what I mean?

575
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,786
Why didn't you tell her?

576
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,664
Bellatrix.

577
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,002
You knew it was me.

578
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,255
You didn't say anything.

579
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,298
Come on, Draco.

580
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,635
Don't be a prat. Do him.

581
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,804
Easy.

582
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,473
Expelliarmus.

583
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,724
Avada Kedavra!

584
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:14,892
Stupefy!

585
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,400
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

586
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,631
Got it.

587
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,764
Run!

588
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,183
Run!

589
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,107
Goyle's setting the
bloody place on fire!

590
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,009
Come on! This way!

591
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,310
We can't leave them.

592
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,646
He's joking, right?

593
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,157
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

594
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,515
Harry!

595
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,271
My Lord?

596
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,982
Avada Kedavra!

597
01:07:56,322 --> 01:08:00,576
Come, Nagini.
I need to keep you safe.

598
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,799
It's the snake.

599
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:18,552
She's the last one.
It's the last Horcrux.

600
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,645
Look inside him, Harry.

601
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,565
Find out where he is. If we
find him, we can find the snake.

602
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,859
Then we can end this.

603
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,305
My Lord?

604
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,351
Might it be less, uh...

605
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:12,439
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

606
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,484
...and simply seek
the boy yourself?

607
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,988
I do not need to seek the boy.

608
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:23,576
Before the night is out, he will
come to me. Do you understand?

609
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,496
Look at me.

610
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,625
How can you live with
yourself, Lucius?

611
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,586
I don't know.

612
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,215
Go and find Severus.

613
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,885
Bring him to me.

614
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,936
I know where he is.

615
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,698
Come on!

616
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,865
Crucio!

617
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,039
No!

618
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,463
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

619
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,632
...in the last few hours alone.

620
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,592
No.

621
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:49,305
No, I am extraordinary...

622
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:53,100
...but the wand resists me.

623
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:56,353
There is no wand more powerful.

624
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,314
Ollivander himself has said it.

625
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:05,112
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

626
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,992
It answers to you...

627
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,203
...and you only.

628
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,414
Does it?

629
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,960
My Lord?

630
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:26,592
The wand, does it
truly answer to me?

631
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,471
You're a clever man, Severus.

632
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:32,556
Surely you must know.

633
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,936
Where does its true loyalty lie?

634
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,230
With you...

635
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,816
...of course, my Lord.

636
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,193
The Elder Wand...

637
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:50,783
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

638
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:57,414
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

639
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:06,965
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

640
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:13,097
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

641
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:18,310
You've been a good and
faithful servant, Severus...

642
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:23,899
...but only I can live forever.

643
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:28,237
My Lord...

644
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,328
Nagini, kill.

645
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,099
Take them.

646
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,227
Take them.

647
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,521
Please.

648
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:48,358
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

649
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,170
Take them to the Pensieve.

650
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,717
Look at me.

651
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:22,184
You have your mother's eyes.

652
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:59,429
You have fought valiantly...

653
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,559
...but in vain.

654
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,106
I do not wish this.

655
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:14,820
Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.

656
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:19,783
I therefore command
my forces to retreat.

657
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:25,455
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.

658
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:32,004
Harry Potter, I now
speak directly to you.

659
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:37,551
On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...

660
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:40,220
...rather than face me yourself.

661
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:43,974
There is no greater dishonor.

662
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:49,104
Join me in the Forbidden
Forest and confront your fate.

663
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,941
If you do not do this...

664
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:59,823
...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...

665
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:04,536
...who tries to
conceal you from me.

666
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:26,058
Where is everybody?

667
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:51,875
Harry.

668
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:00,300
Oh, come on. What's
the matter with you?

669
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,094
Oh, she's passed.

670
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,390
There, she's gone.

671
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,186
Freak!

672
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,854
Come here.

673
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,065
I'm gonna tell Mummy.
You're a freak.

674
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,692
You're a freak, Lily!

675
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:24,444
Come here.

676
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:48,718
She's jealous because she's
ordinary and you're special.

677
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,429
That's mean, Severus.

678
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,329
Gryffindor!

679
01:21:23,878 --> 01:21:26,798
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

680
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:35,515
Just like your father.
Lazy. Arrogant.

681
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,517
Don't say a word against my father.

682
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:45,442
Blood shall be spilt...

683
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:50,614
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

684
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,657
Severus.

685
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,744
No. Don't kill me.

686
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,748
The prophecy did not
refer to a woman.

687
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:02,167
It spoke of a boy born
at the end of July.

688
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,586
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

689
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,340
He intends to hunt them
down now, to kill them.

690
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:13,011
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

691
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,306
What will you give me
in exchange, Severus?

692
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,100
Anything.

693
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:23,980
Harry. Harry, you are
so loved. So loved.

694
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,651
Harry, Mama loves you.

695
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:30,695
Dada loves you.

696
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:33,740
Harry, be safe.

697
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:34,949
Be strong.

698
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,618
Avada Kedavra!

699
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:45,585
You said you would keep her safe.

700
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:49,798
Lily and James put their faith
in the wrong person, Severus.

701
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,842
Rather like you.

702
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,429
The boy survives.

703
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:59,057
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

704
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,267
The Dark Lord will return.

705
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:05,021
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger.

706
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,566
He has her eyes.

707
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:15,198
If you truly loved her...

708
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:21,746
No one can know.

709
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:24,541
That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?

710
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:25,625
Your word.

711
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,670
When you risk your life every
day to protect the boy?

712
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,590
He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...

713
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,426
...and he seems to relish his fame.

714
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:37,470
Don't say a word against my father.

715
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,848
James Potter?

716
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,516
Lazy, arrogant.

717
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,018
My father was a great man.

718
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,103
Your father was a swine!

719
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:48,565
Drink the rest.

720
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:52,777
It will contain the curse to
your hand for the time being.

721
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,904
It will spread, Albus.

722
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:56,740
How long?

723
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,201
Maybe a year.

724
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:03,663
Don't ignore me, Severus.

725
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,248
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

726
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:09,377
We both know Lord Voldemort has
ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

727
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,675
But should he fail, one
should presume the Dark Lord...

728
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,969
...will turn to you.

729
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:24,642
You must be the one
to kill me, Severus.

730
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,978
It is the only way.

731
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:32,317
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.

732
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,153
Avada Kedavra.

733
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:43,328
There will come a time when Harry
Potter must be told something.

734
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:50,126
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

735
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:53,171
Must be told what?

736
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,381
On the night Lord Voldemort...

737
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:58,760
...went to Godric's
Hollow to kill Harry...

738
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,472
...and Lily Potter cast
herself between them...

739
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,183
... the curse rebounded.

740
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:10,647
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

741
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:15,652
... latched itself onto the
only living thing it could find:

742
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,946
Harry himself.

743
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,700
There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes.

744
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:26,121
There's a reason he can look
into Lord Voldemort's mind.

745
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:34,546
A part of Voldemort
lives inside him.

746
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,930
So when the time comes...

747
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:47,016
...the boy must die?

748
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:50,937
Yes. Yes.

749
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,398
He must die.

750
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:16,546
You've kept him alive so that
he can die at the proper moment.

751
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,761
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

752
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:28,349
Don't tell me now that you've
grown to care for the boy?

753
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:36,107
Expecto Patronum.

754
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,536
Lily.

755
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,167
After all this time?

756
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,714
Always.

757
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:07,847
So when the time comes...

758
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:11,017
...the boy must die?

759
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:14,562
Yes. He must die.

760
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:17,732
And Voldemort himself must do it.

761
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:20,360
That is essential.

762
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,467
Where've you been?

763
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,804
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

764
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,932
Are you mad? No.

765
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,185
You can't give yourself up to him.

766
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:41,399
What is it, Harry?

767
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:44,902
What is it you know?

768
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:50,241
There's a reason I can hear them...

769
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,076
...the Horcruxes.

770
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,956
I think I've known for a while.

771
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,668
And I think you have too.

772
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:06,799
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

773
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,677
Kill the snake and
then it's just him.

774
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:31,926
I'm ready to die.

775
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,678
The Resurrection Stone.

776
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,753
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

777
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:54,675
Why are you here?

778
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,261
All of you?

779
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,807
We never left.

780
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,276
Does it...?

781
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,237
Does it hurt?

782
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:16,948
Dying?

783
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:20,409
Quicker than falling asleep.

784
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:26,624
You're nearly there, son.

785
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,000
I'm sorry.

786
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,671
I never wanted any
of you to die for me.

787
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:34,882
And, Remus, your son...

788
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:39,303
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

789
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:42,932
One day, he'll understand.

790
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,237
You'll stay with me?

791
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:00,074
Until the end.

792
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:02,743
And he won't be able to see you?

793
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,578
No.

794
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,457
We're here, you see.

795
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:25,057
Stay close to me.

796
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:28,978
Always.

797
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:47,455
No sign of him, my Lord.

798
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:05,681
I thought he would come.

799
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:50,184
Harry? No! What
are you doing here?

800
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:51,644
Quiet!

801
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:04,907
Harry Potter.

802
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,746
The Boy Who Lived.

803
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,420
Come to die.

804
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,314
Avada Kedavra!

805
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,414
You can't help.

806
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:37,416
Harry...

807
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,252
...you wonderful boy.

808
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:44,673
You brave, brave man.

809
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,594
Let us walk.

810
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,312
Professor, what is that?

811
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:04,026
Something beyond
either of our help.

812
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:10,199
A part of Voldemort
sent here to die.

813
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:11,826
And exactly where are we?

814
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:16,997
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

815
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:18,874
Well...

816
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,669
... it looks like King's Cross station.

817
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:24,338
Only cleaner.

818
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,715
And without all the trains.

819
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:30,010
King's Cross, is that right?

820
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:33,931
This is, as they say, your party.

821
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,102
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

822
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:41,105
... have been connected by
something other than fate...

823
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:44,316
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.

824
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:46,235
So it's true then, sir?

825
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:49,363
A part of him lives
within me, doesn't it?

826
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:50,739
Did.

827
01:37:50,906 --> 01:37:55,703
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

828
01:37:56,787 --> 01:38:01,458
You were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

829
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:15,556
I have to go back, haven't l?

830
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,641
Oh. That's up to you.

831
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:19,560
I have a choice?

832
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,520
Oh, yes.

833
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,523
We're in King's Cross, you say?

834
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:30,446
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

835
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:33,157
And where would it take me?

836
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,577
On.

837
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,639
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

838
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:00,351
True.

839
01:39:00,517 --> 01:39:03,312
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

840
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:06,023
And I've nothing to kill it with.

841
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:11,320
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

842
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:16,200
I've always prized myself on
my ability to turn a phrase.

843
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:20,287
Words are, in my not
so humble opinion...

844
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:24,041
...our most inexhaustible
source of magic...

845
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:28,545
...capable of both inflicting
injury and remedying it.

846
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:35,094
But I would, in this case, amend
my original statement to this:

847
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:44,061
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who deserve it.

848
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,695
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

849
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:55,155
Pity the living.

850
01:39:55,739 --> 01:40:00,577
And, above all, all those
who live without love.

851
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:06,959
Professor, my mother's
Patronus was a doe, wasn't it?

852
01:40:08,043 --> 01:40:10,629
That's the same as
Professor Snape's.

853
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:13,590
It's curious, don't you think?

854
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:18,721
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

855
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:22,599
I'll be going now, Harry.

856
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:24,476
Professor?

857
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:31,150
Is this all real?

858
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:33,819
Or is it just happening
inside my head?

859
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:37,364
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

860
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:41,285
Why should that mean
that it's not real?

861
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:50,461
Professor? What should I do?

862
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:56,008
Professor?

863
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:00,679
My Lord?

864
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:02,973
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

865
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,767
I don't need your help.

866
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:07,644
No. Come.

867
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:18,197
The boy.

868
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:20,324
Is he dead?

869
01:41:34,379 --> 01:41:36,590
Is he alive?

870
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:38,967
Draco, is he alive?

871
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,538
Dead.

872
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:36,919
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

873
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:39,421
Neville, who is it?

874
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:42,591
Harry Potter...

875
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,260
...is dead.

876
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:46,970
No! No!

877
01:43:47,137 --> 01:43:48,513
Silence.

878
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,311
Stupid girl.

879
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:58,899
Harry Potter is dead.

880
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:04,196
From this day forth,
you put your faith...

881
01:44:04,363 --> 01:44:05,447
...in me.

882
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:18,252
Harry Potter is dead!

883
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,551
And now is the time
to declare yourself.

884
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:30,847
Come forward and join us.

885
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,476
Or die.

886
01:44:40,023 --> 01:44:41,108
Draco.

887
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:48,615
Draco.

888
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:53,412
Draco...

889
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,166
...come.

890
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:12,556
Ah. Well done, Draco.

891
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,225
Well done.

892
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:40,542
Well, I must say I'd
hoped for better.

893
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:47,883
And who might you
be, young man?

894
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:51,094
Neville Longbottom.

895
01:45:56,391 --> 01:46:00,062
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

896
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,481
I'd like to say something.

897
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:14,409
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

898
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:20,082
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

899
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:22,667
People die every day.

900
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:28,423
Friends, family.

901
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:32,010
Yeah.

902
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,597
We lost Harry tonight.

903
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:41,645
But he's still with us, in here.

904
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:44,606
So's Fred...

905
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:47,359
...and Remus.

906
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:49,820
Tonks.

907
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:53,031
All of them.

908
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:56,451
They didn't die in vain.

909
01:47:01,623 --> 01:47:02,666
But you will.

910
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,210
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

911
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,380
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us.

912
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:10,132
This is not over!

913
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:16,096
Confringo!

914
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:25,981
No! No, come back!

915
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:30,068
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!

916
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:32,320
Come back!

917
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:40,495
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

918
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,581
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

919
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:38,673
Not my daughter, you bitch.

920
01:51:12,123 --> 01:51:13,458
You were right...

921
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,545
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

922
01:51:17,754 --> 01:51:19,381
It will always fail you.

923
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:22,258
I killed Snape.

924
01:51:22,425 --> 01:51:24,719
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

925
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:27,597
What if its allegiance was
always to someone else?

926
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:30,975
Come on, Tom. Let's finish
this the way we started it.

927
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:32,519
Together.

928
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:09,152
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.

929
01:55:09,152 --> 01:55:13,489
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

930
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:15,617
It was lost in the
folds of my gowns.

931
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:18,620
I managed to find it and I
dispatched a few of them...

932
01:55:18,786 --> 01:55:19,996
Harry.

933
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:24,185
Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?

934
01:56:25,144 --> 01:56:27,063
It answered to somebody else.

935
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:30,984
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

936
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:35,154
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

937
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:39,826
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

938
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:44,038
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

939
01:56:44,914 --> 01:56:46,749
Until...

940
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:51,462
...the other night when I
disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

941
01:56:51,629 --> 01:56:53,756
So that means...

942
01:56:55,299 --> 01:56:57,051
It's mine.

943
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:00,471
What should we do with it?

944
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,682
We?

945
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:07,311
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

946
01:57:07,478 --> 01:57:11,441
With that, we'd be invincible.

947
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:36,210
Together.

948
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:55,730
Look after each other.

949
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:16,667
- Bag?
- Yeah.

950
02:00:16,834 --> 02:00:17,919
Jumper?

951
02:00:19,587 --> 02:00:21,589
I'll miss you.

952
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:24,425
Here they come.

953
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:43,778
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

954
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:48,616
Albus Severus Potter...

955
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:53,621
...you were named after two
headmasters of Hogwarts.

956
02:00:53,829 --> 02:00:55,414
One of them was a Slytherin...

957
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:58,793
...and he was the bravest
man I've ever known.

958
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:01,963
But just say that I am.

959
02:01:02,129 --> 02:01:07,718
Then Slytherin House will have
gained a wonderful young wizard.

960
02:01:07,885 --> 02:01:13,599
But, listen, if it really means that
much to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

961
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:16,686
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

962
02:01:17,311 --> 02:01:19,313
- Really?
- Really.

963
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:23,359
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

964
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:24,610
Ready?

965
02:01:24,735 --> 02:01:26,320
Ready.

966
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:40,167
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

967
02:01:40,376 --> 02:01:41,836
Come on.
