waved their wands and made a bridge.

1259
02:01:31,325 --> 02:01:33,411
Before they could cross, however...

1260
02:01:33,577 --> 02:01:37,707
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1261
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:41,836
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1262
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:45,089
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1263
02:01:45,256 --> 02:01:47,300
But Death was cunning.

1264
02:01:47,925 --> 02:01:50,928
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1265
02:01:51,095 --> 02:01:56,392
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1266
02:01:56,934 --> 02:02:01,522
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1267
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:06,277
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1268
02:02:07,695 --> 02:02:11,991
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1269
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:16,620
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1270
02:02:17,038 --> 02:02:21,333
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1271
02:02:22,084 --> 02:02:26,047
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1272
02:02:27,256 --> 02:02:28,674
A humble man...

1273
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:33,054
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1274
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:36,390
...without being followed by Death.

1275
02:02:37,475 --> 02:02:43,355
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1276
02:02:46,734 --> 02:02:49,695
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1277
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:51,947
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1278
02:02:52,114 --> 02:02:55,868
...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

1279
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:01,624
Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...

1280
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,877
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1281
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,342
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1282
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:14,678
...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1283
02:03:14,845 --> 02:03:18,307
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1284
02:03:19,016 --> 02:03:21,018
The second brother journeyed
to his home...

1285
02:03:21,185 --> 02:03:24,146
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.

1286
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:28,776
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...

1287
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:31,320
...appeared before him.

1288
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:37,118
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1289
02:03:37,284 --> 02:03:38,911
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1290
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:42,414
...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.

1291
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:46,710
And so Death took the second brother.

1292
02:03:46,877 --> 02:03:48,504
As for the third brother...

1293
02:03:48,671 --> 02:03:52,925
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.

1294
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:55,970
Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...

1295
02:03:56,137 --> 02:04:00,432
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
and give it to his son.

1296
02:04:01,642 --> 02:04:05,771
He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...

I'm still working on that part.

1571
02:29:25,206 --> 02:29:26,499
He's weak.

1572
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,510
Yes?

1573
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:43,349
Mr. Ollivander, I need to
ask you a few questions.

1574
02:29:43,557 --> 02:29:46,310
Anything, my boy, anything.

1575
02:29:47,269 --> 02:29:49,855
Would you mind
identifying this wand?

1576
02:29:50,022 --> 02:29:52,650
We need to know if
it's safe to use.

1577
02:29:58,572 --> 02:30:00,366
Walnut.

1578
02:30:01,242 --> 02:30:03,828
Dragon heartstring.

1579
02:30:04,453 --> 02:30:07,248
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

1580
02:30:08,207 --> 02:30:10,042
Unyie...

1581
02:30:12,128 --> 02:30:13,796
Unyielding.

1582
02:30:14,922 --> 02:30:19,135
This belonged to
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1583
02:30:19,301 --> 02:30:22,096
Treat it carefully.

1584
02:30:22,847 --> 02:30:24,098
And this?

1585
02:30:27,476 --> 02:30:29,395
Hawthorn.

1586
02:30:30,688 --> 02:30:33,315
And unicorn hair.

1587
02:30:33,482 --> 02:30:38,154
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

1588
02:30:41,699 --> 02:30:46,245
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

1589
02:30:46,954 --> 02:30:49,457
Was? Is it not still?

1590
02:30:49,623 --> 02:30:53,753
Well, perhaps not,
if you won it from him.

1591
02:30:56,130 --> 02:30:59,759
I sense its allegiance has changed.

1592
02:31:04,472 --> 02:31:09,351
You talk about wands as
if they have feelings...

1593
02:31:11,312 --> 02:31:12,563
...can think.

1594
02:31:15,983 --> 02:31:20,404
The wand chooses the
wizard, Mr. Potter.

1595
02:31:20,988 --> 02:31:25,910
That much has always been clear to
those of us who have studied wandlore.

1596
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:30,498
And what do you know about
the Deathly Hallows?

1597
02:31:40,382 --> 02:31:42,468
The Elder Wand...

1598
02:31:43,219 --> 02:31:48,474
...the Cloak of Invisibility to
hide you from your enemies...

1599
02:31:48,682 --> 02:31:54,480
...and the Resurrection Stone to
bring back loved ones from the dead.

1600
02:31:54,688 --> 02:31:59,610
Together, they make
one the master of death.

1601
02:31:59,819 --> 02:32:05,908
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

1602
02:32:06,075 --> 02:32:07,743
Do you?

1603
02:32:08,369 --> 02:32:10,496
Do you believe they exist, sir?

1604
02:32:13,874 --> 02:32:20,631
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

1605
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:22,299
You're lying.

1606
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:25,761
You know one exists.

1607
02:32:25,928 --> 02:32:27,763
You told him about it.

1608
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:33,477
You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.

1609
02:32:36,939 --> 02:32:39,066
He tortured me.

1610
02:32:41,694 --> 02:32:43,571
Besides...

1611
02:32:44,572 --> 02:32:47,283
...I only conveyed rumors.

1612
02:32:49,034 --> 02:32:50,578
There's...

1613
02:32:51,787 --> 02:32:54,957
There's no telling
whether he will find it.

1614
02:32:58,002 --> 02:32:59,879
He has found it, sir.

1615
02:33:05,759 --> 02:33:07,553
We'll let you rest.

1616
02:33:10,097 --> 02:33:12,474
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

1617
02:33:12,975 --> 02:33:18,939
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

1618
02:33:20,733 --> 02:33:22,401
...I'm afraid...

1619
02:33:22,985 --> 02:33:25,946
...you really don't stand a chance.

1620
02:33:27,114 --> 02:33:30,701
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill
him before he finds me, then.

1621
02:33:35,956 --> 02:33:38,125
Are you sure that's hers?

1622
02:33:39,877 --> 02:33:41,420
Positive.

1623
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:52,056
How do we know what it is
when we get in there?

1624
02:33:52,056 --> 02:33:53,807
Horcruxes could be anything.

1625
02:33:53,807 --> 02:33:55,935
I'll ... I'll know.

1626
02:33:56,936 --> 02:33:58,938
How?

1627
02:33:59,772 --> 02:34:01,982
I don't know how to explain it.

1628
02:34:01,982 --> 02:34:03,776
But I'll know.

1629
02:34:05,778 --> 02:34:08,781
This is the closest I could find
to what you described.

1630
02:34:08,781 --> 02:34:11,325
It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.

1631
02:34:16,789 --> 02:34:18,832
You're leaving, aren't you?

1632
02:34:18,832 --> 02:34:20,876
HARRY:
In the morning.

1633
02:34:20,876 --> 02:34:22,378
And Griphook?

1634
02:34:22,378 --> 02:34:24,046
He's coming with us.

1635
02:34:24,046 --> 02:34:26,340
Listen, I know goblins.

1636
02:34:27,007 --> 02:34:33,681
If you've struck any kind of bargin with Griphook,
you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it.

1637
02:34:34,306 --> 02:34:39,311
If you don't, he won't be forgiving.

1638
02:34:50,990 --> 02:34:53,242
The sky has lost a star.

1639
02:34:54,243 --> 02:34:57,997
My father used to say that
when a child died.

1640
02:35:00,582 --> 02:35:04,962
Funny how Mr. Dobby knew
exactly where to find us.

1641
02:35:05,713 --> 02:35:07,464
Yeah, it's funny.

1642
02:35:14,138 --> 02:35:15,806
Hogwarts?

1643
02:35:17,349 --> 02:35:20,436
It's not the place you left, you know?

1644
02:35:20,436 --> 02:35:22,563
It's not the same.

1645
02:35:23,814 --> 02:35:26,025
Neither am I.

1646
02:35:37,494 --> 02:35:41,081
Always "good day to you".
I'll miss her.

1647
02:35:42,082 --> 02:35:43,917
What do you think?

1648
02:35:43,917 --> 02:35:47,337
I wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.

1649
02:35:53,343 --> 02:35:55,429
You gonna tell me what that is?

1650
02:35:57,723 --> 02:36:00,642
You're going to think I'm mental, but...

1651
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:04,646
...more than once when I've looked into it,
I've seen Dumbledore.

1652
02:36:06,523 --> 02:36:08,692
Bloody hell. That's a sight.

1653
02:36:12,571 --> 02:36:14,156
Well?

1654
02:36:15,199 --> 02:36:17,034
How do I look?

1655
02:36:17,868 --> 02:36:19,578
Hideous.

1656
02:36:43,394 --> 02:36:44,520
We're relying on you, Griphook.

1657
02:36:44,728 --> 02:36:48,732
If you get us past the guards and
into the vault, the sword's yours.

1658
02:37:01,286 --> 02:37:02,496
Madam Lestrange.

1659
02:37:02,663 --> 02:37:04,415
Good morning.

1660
02:37:05,749 --> 02:37:09,294
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

1661
02:37:09,461 --> 02:37:12,589
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

1662
02:37:12,756 --> 02:37:14,466
Hey. Easy.

1663
02:37:14,633 --> 02:37:19,221
She gives us away, we might as well
use that sword to slit our own throats.

1664
02:37:19,388 --> 02:37:21,265
Understand?

1665
02:37:21,432 --> 02:37:24,893
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

1666
02:37:25,185 --> 02:37:26,687
Okay.

1667
02:37:26,937 --> 02:37:28,564
Let's do it.

1668
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:36,131
I wish to enter my vault.

1669
02:38:39,343 --> 02:38:41,595
Identification?

1670
02:38:44,681 --> 02:38:47,226
I hardly think
that'll be necessary.

1671
02:38:49,770 --> 02:38:51,605
Madam Lestrange.

1672
02:38:56,818 --> 02:38:59,029
I don't like to be kept waiting.

1673
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:01,198
They know.

1674
02:39:01,365 --> 02:39:03,492
They know she's an imposter.

1675
02:39:06,370 --> 02:39:08,163
They've been warned.

1676
02:39:16,213 --> 02:39:17,756
Harry?

1677
02:39:18,465 --> 02:39:20,509
What do we do, Harry?

1678
02:39:25,973 --> 02:39:29,893
Madam Lestrange, would you
mind presenting your wand?

1679
02:39:30,811 --> 02:39:32,062
And why should I do that?

1680
02:39:32,229 --> 02:39:37,818
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

1681
02:39:37,985 --> 02:39:41,113
No. I most certainly
do not understand.

1682
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:45,117
I'm afraid I must insist.

1683
02:39:50,372 --> 02:39:52,332
Imperio.

1684
02:39:57,796 --> 02:40:02,009
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

1685
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:39,379
What is that, Griphook?

1686
02:40:44,801 --> 02:40:46,136
Griphook.

1687
02:41:04,613 --> 02:41:07,616
Arresto momentum.

1688
02:41:11,244 --> 02:41:12,621
Well done, Hermione.

1689
02:41:20,921 --> 02:41:22,798
Oh, no, you look like you again.

1690
02:41:23,423 --> 02:41:27,260
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

1691
02:41:27,427 --> 02:41:28,512
Can be deadly.

1692
02:41:28,679 --> 02:41:30,305
You don't say.

1693
02:41:30,514 --> 02:41:33,475
Just out of interest, is there
any other way out of here?

1694
02:41:33,683 --> 02:41:35,352
No.

1695
02:41:36,269 --> 02:41:40,190
What the devil are all
you doing down here?

1696
02:41:40,357 --> 02:41:41,608
Thieves!

1697
02:41:41,775 --> 02:41:44,027
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Imperio.

1698
02:41:55,122 --> 02:41:57,332
That doesn't sound good.

1699
02:42:07,676 --> 02:42:09,052
Bloody hell.

1700
02:42:09,219 --> 02:42:10,720
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

1701
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:12,264
Here.

1702
02:42:22,858 --> 02:42:26,236
It's been trained to expect
pain when it hears the noise.

1703
02:42:26,403 --> 02:42:27,946
That's barbaric.

1704
02:42:57,642 --> 02:42:59,603
Lumos.

1705
02:43:03,732 --> 02:43:05,233
Blimey.

1706
02:43:12,365 --> 02:43:14,534
Accio Horcrux.

1707
02:43:16,077 --> 02:43:18,163
You're not trying that
one again, are you?

1708
02:43:18,246 --> 02:43:21,041
That kind of magic
won't work in here.

1709
02:43:25,253 --> 02:43:27,255
Is it in here, Harry?

1710
02:43:28,089 --> 02:43:29,508
Can you feel anything?

1711
02:43:51,238 --> 02:43:53,824
That's it. Up there.

1712
02:43:57,327 --> 02:44:00,789
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

1713
02:44:00,831 --> 02:44:02,290
Give me the sword.

1714
02:44:20,308 --> 02:44:21,977
Stop moving.

1715
02:44:44,374 --> 02:44:45,834
Got it.

1716
02:44:48,461 --> 02:44:50,046
We had a deal, Griphook.

1717
02:44:50,213 --> 02:44:51,590
The cup for the sword.

1718
02:44:57,304 --> 02:45:02,309
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say
anything about getting you out.

1719
02:45:23,914 --> 02:45:24,998
Griphook!

1720
02:45:25,165 --> 02:45:26,833
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!

1721
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,835
Thieves!

1722
02:45:31,504 --> 02:45:34,424
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

1723
02:45:41,806 --> 02:45:43,350
That's unfortunate.

1724
02:45:47,312 --> 02:45:49,522
We can't just stand here.
Who's got an idea?

1725
02:45:49,689 --> 02:45:51,232
You're the brilliant one.

1726
02:45:51,399 --> 02:45:53,652
I've got something, but it's mad.

1727
02:45:53,818 --> 02:45:55,153
Reducto.

1728
02:46:08,083 --> 02:46:09,209
Well, come on, then.

1729
02:46:11,836 --> 02:46:13,922
Relashio.

1730
02:47:00,552 --> 02:47:02,512
Keep moving! Aah!

1731
02:47:29,080 --> 02:47:30,248
Now what?

1732
02:47:30,415 --> 02:47:31,750
Reducto.

1733
02:47:33,001 --> 02:47:34,377
Hold on.

1734
02:47:43,928 --> 02:47:47,849
That was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

1735
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:16,920
We're dropping.

1736
02:48:19,923 --> 02:48:22,175
- I say we jump.
-When?

1737
02:48:22,342 --> 02:48:23,718
Now.

1738
02:49:18,147 --> 02:49:21,109
He knows. You-Know-Who.

1739
02:49:21,276 --> 02:49:22,902
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

1740
02:49:23,027 --> 02:49:26,239
He knows what we took and he
knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

1741
02:49:26,406 --> 02:49:28,199
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

1742
02:49:28,366 --> 02:49:30,827
You let him in? Harry,
you can't do that.

1743
02:49:30,994 --> 02:49:34,581
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

1744
02:49:34,747 --> 02:49:36,457
Never mind. What happened?

1745
02:49:36,624 --> 02:49:38,418
Well, he's angry.

1746
02:49:38,585 --> 02:49:40,128
And scared too.

1747
02:49:40,128 --> 02:49:44,007
He knows if we find and destroy all the
Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

1748
02:49:44,007 --> 02:49:47,635
I reckon he'll stop at nothing to
make sure we don't find the rest.

1749
02:49:48,845 --> 02:49:51,139
There's more.
One of them's at Hogwarts.

1750
02:49:51,306 --> 02:49:53,016
What?

1751
02:49:53,183 --> 02:49:55,810
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

1752
02:49:56,019 --> 02:49:58,563
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

1753
02:49:58,730 --> 02:50:02,025
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

1754
02:50:02,191 --> 02:50:05,320
Hermione, when have any of our
plans ever actually worked?

1755
02:50:05,528 --> 02:50:07,906
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

1756
02:50:09,032 --> 02:50:10,325
He's right.

1757
02:50:10,491 --> 02:50:14,704
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.

1758
02:50:14,871 --> 02:50:19,667
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

1759
02:50:19,834 --> 02:50:22,170
Take the secret
passage in the cellar.

1760
02:50:22,337 --> 02:50:25,715
It's... There's something
wrong with him.

1761
02:50:25,882 --> 02:50:30,219
It's like, you know, in the past, I've
always been able to follow his thoughts.

1762
02:50:30,386 --> 02:50:33,222
And now everything
just feels disconnected.

1763
02:50:33,389 --> 02:50:34,724
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

1764
02:50:34,891 --> 02:50:37,018
Maybe he's growing weaker.
Maybe he's dying.

1765
02:50:37,060 --> 02:50:40,188
No. No, it's more
like he's wounded.

1766
02:50:40,355 --> 02:50:43,149
If anything,
he feels more dangerous.

1767
02:51:30,154 --> 02:51:34,659
- They're here!
- Search everywhere!

1768
02:51:34,659 --> 02:51:37,370
Look down by the stables!
You two, come with me!

1769
02:51:38,037 --> 02:51:39,539
Any sign?

1770
02:51:55,054 --> 02:51:56,097
Potter!

1771
02:52:09,318 --> 02:52:10,820
In here, Potter.

1772
02:52:24,334 --> 02:52:26,294
Did you get a look at him?

1773
02:52:26,461 --> 02:52:29,255
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

1774
02:52:45,855 --> 02:52:47,190
Harry?

1775
02:52:49,192 --> 02:52:51,402
I can see you in this.

1776
02:53:04,082 --> 02:53:07,168
You bloody fools. What were
you thinking coming here?

1777
02:53:07,335 --> 02:53:09,587
Have you any idea
how dangerous it is?

1778
02:53:09,754 --> 02:53:13,424
You're Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.

1779
02:53:14,008 --> 02:53:15,885
It's you who I've
been seeing in here.

1780
02:53:16,636 --> 02:53:18,221
You're the one who sent Dobby.

1781
02:53:18,388 --> 02:53:19,722
Where have you left him?

1782
02:53:20,139 --> 02:53:21,432
He's dead.

1783
02:53:22,058 --> 02:53:24,018
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

1784
02:53:24,227 --> 02:53:27,146
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

1785
02:53:27,563 --> 02:53:29,941
Mundungus Fletcher,
about a year ago.

1786
02:53:30,108 --> 02:53:33,403
-Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.

1787
02:53:33,903 --> 02:53:35,738
Albus told me.

1788
02:53:36,364 --> 02:53:40,576
He also told me you'd likely be hacked
off if you ever found out I had it...

1789
02:53:40,743 --> 02:53:45,623
...but ask yourself, where
would you be if I didn't?

1790
02:53:48,584 --> 02:53:51,295
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

1791
02:53:51,462 --> 02:53:53,423
The Order's finished.

1792
02:53:53,589 --> 02:53:54,966
You-Know-Who's won.

1793
02:53:55,133 --> 02:53:58,553
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

1794
02:53:58,719 --> 02:54:01,222
We need to get into
Hogwarts, tonight.

1795
02:54:01,681 --> 02:54:03,391
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

1796
02:54:03,558 --> 02:54:05,226
Did he now?

1797
02:54:05,393 --> 02:54:07,812
Nice job? Easy?

1798
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:10,940
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

1799
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:14,694
We think the last one's inside the
castle, but we'll need help getting in.

1800
02:54:14,694 --> 02:54:18,406
That's not a job my brother's
given you. It's a suicide mission.

1801
02:54:18,573 --> 02:54:21,951
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

1802
02:54:22,118 --> 02:54:26,789
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

1803
02:54:26,789 --> 02:54:29,917
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

1804
02:54:29,917 --> 02:54:33,671
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

1805
02:54:34,630 --> 02:54:36,757
Did he ever mention hers?

1806
02:54:36,966 --> 02:54:40,636
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

1807
02:54:41,637 --> 02:54:45,141
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

1808
02:54:45,308 --> 02:54:48,436
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

1809
02:54:48,603 --> 02:54:51,439
...who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

1810
02:54:51,981 --> 02:54:55,818
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

1811
02:54:55,985 --> 02:54:57,987
That's what a fool does.

1812
02:54:58,154 --> 02:55:02,074
You don't strike me
as a fool, Harry Potter.

1813
02:55:02,241 --> 02:55:06,913
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

1814
02:55:08,956 --> 02:55:12,251
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

1815
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:15,213
I don't care that you've given up.

1816
02:55:17,673 --> 02:55:20,301
I trusted the man I knew.

1817
02:55:23,387 --> 02:55:26,474
And we need to get
into the castle tonight.

1818
02:55:31,729 --> 02:55:34,190
You know what to do.

1819
02:55:40,780 --> 02:55:42,698
Where have you sent her?

1820
02:55:43,199 --> 02:55:46,744
You'll see soon enough.

1821
02:55:52,959 --> 02:55:55,711
That's your sister,
Ariana, isn't it?

1822
02:55:56,546 --> 02:55:59,423
She died very young, didn't she?

1823
02:56:00,383 --> 02:56:04,095
My brother sacrificed
many things, Mr. Potter...

1824
02:56:04,262 --> 02:56:06,764
...on his journey to find power...

1825
02:56:06,931 --> 02:56:09,225
...including Ariana.

1826
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:12,520
And she was devoted to him.

1827
02:56:13,104 --> 02:56:15,565
He gave her everything...

1828
02:56:16,524 --> 02:56:18,234
...but time.

1829
02:56:19,610 --> 02:56:22,029
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

1830
02:56:28,869 --> 02:56:31,372
He did save our lives twice.

1831
02:56:32,039 --> 02:56:34,208
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

1832
02:56:35,418 --> 02:56:38,504
That doesn't seem like
someone who's given up.

1833
02:56:43,676 --> 02:56:45,761
She's coming back.

1834
02:56:46,554 --> 02:56:48,639
Who's that with her?

1835
02:56:55,938 --> 02:56:56,981
Neville.

1836
02:56:57,148 --> 02:56:59,692
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

1837
02:56:59,859 --> 02:57:02,445
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

1838
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:06,657
Hey, Ab, we've got a
couple more coming through.

1839
02:57:06,657 --> 02:57:09,910
Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.

1840
02:57:09,910 --> 02:57:11,954
That's because it never
existed till now.

1841
02:57:11,954 --> 02:57:15,416
The seven secret passages were sealed
off before the start of the year.

1842
02:57:15,416 --> 02:57:17,168
This is the only way in or out now.

1843
02:57:17,168 --> 02:57:20,129
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

1844
02:57:20,129 --> 02:57:21,881
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

1845
02:57:22,048 --> 02:57:25,134
Hardly ever see him. It's the
Carrows you need to watch out for.

1846
02:57:25,134 --> 02:57:26,218
Carrows?

1847
02:57:26,344 --> 02:57:28,846
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

1848
02:57:28,971 --> 02:57:30,723
They like punishment, the Carrows.

1849
02:57:30,848 --> 02:57:32,892
They did that to you? Why?

1850
02:57:33,059 --> 02:57:36,729
Today's Dark Arts lessons had us
practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

1851
02:57:36,896 --> 02:57:38,814
On first-years.

1852
02:57:38,981 --> 02:57:40,816
I refused.

1853
02:57:41,609 --> 02:57:43,736
Hogwarts has changed.

1854
02:57:56,624 --> 02:57:59,085
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

1855
02:58:04,173 --> 02:58:07,134
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

1856
02:58:07,301 --> 02:58:11,389
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

1857
02:58:14,225 --> 02:58:15,309
Blimey.

1858
02:58:15,518 --> 02:58:17,853
- Harry!
- Yeah!

1859
02:58:30,533 --> 02:58:33,411
Get the word out to Remus and
the others that Harry's back.

1860
02:58:33,411 --> 02:58:35,871
Okay, let's not kill him
before You-Know-Who...

1861
02:58:35,871 --> 02:58:37,373
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

1862
02:58:37,540 --> 02:58:40,584
Lightning has struck.

1863
02:58:40,751 --> 02:58:42,420
What's the plan, Harry?

1864
02:58:47,299 --> 02:58:48,342
Okay.

1865
02:58:49,301 --> 02:58:51,387
There's something we need to find.

1866
02:58:51,554 --> 02:58:56,517
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

1867
02:58:56,726 --> 02:58:58,519
Right. What is it?

1868
02:58:58,686 --> 02:58:59,854
We don't know.

1869
02:59:01,814 --> 02:59:04,734
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

1870
02:59:06,068 --> 02:59:09,321
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

1871
02:59:09,488 --> 02:59:11,949
I think it has something
to do with Ravenclaw.

1872
02:59:12,116 --> 02:59:16,787
Um, it'll be small,
easily concealed.

1873
02:59:17,663 --> 02:59:19,790
Anyone, any ideas?

1874
02:59:21,125 --> 02:59:23,627
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

1875
02:59:23,794 --> 02:59:26,213
Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.

1876
02:59:26,380 --> 02:59:28,424
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

1877
02:59:29,091 --> 02:59:32,887
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

1878
02:59:33,053 --> 02:59:36,432
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

1879
02:59:36,599 --> 02:59:39,393
There isn't a person alive
today who's seen it.

1880
02:59:39,393 --> 02:59:41,937
Excuse me. Can someone tell
me what a bloody diadem is?

1881
02:59:41,937 --> 02:59:44,648
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

1882
02:59:47,943 --> 02:59:49,195
Harry.

1883
02:59:50,446 --> 02:59:51,781
Hi there.

1884
02:59:51,781 --> 02:59:58,162
Six months she hasn't seen me and
it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

1885
02:59:58,162 --> 02:59:59,997
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

1886
03:00:00,122 --> 03:00:02,416
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

1887
03:00:02,583 --> 03:00:04,084
What is it, Ginny?

1888
03:00:04,251 --> 03:00:08,464
Snape knows. He knows that
Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

1889
03:00:18,599 --> 03:00:21,477
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

1890
03:00:57,930 --> 03:01:03,310
Many of you are surely wondering why
I have summoned you at this hour.

1891
03:01:05,771 --> 03:01:09,567
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

1892
03:01:10,985 --> 03:01:13,237
...Harry Potter was
sighted in Hogsmeade.

1893
03:01:15,739 --> 03:01:17,366
Now...

1894
03:01:17,533 --> 03:01:19,118
...should anyone...

1895
03:01:20,786 --> 03:01:26,041
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

1896
03:01:27,167 --> 03:01:29,295
...they will be punished...

1897
03:01:29,461 --> 03:01:33,924
...in a matter consistent with the
severity of their transgression.

1898
03:01:34,091 --> 03:01:36,343
Furthermore...

1899
03:01:36,719 --> 03:01:41,390
...any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

1900
03:01:42,725 --> 03:01:46,645
...who fails to come forward...

1901
03:01:47,605 --> 03:01:52,151
...will be treated as...

1902
03:01:52,818 --> 03:01:56,030
...equally guilty.

1903
03:01:58,324 --> 03:02:00,159
Now then...

1904
03:02:03,621 --> 03:02:05,748
...if anyone here...

1905
03:02:06,206 --> 03:02:12,379
...has any knowledge of Mr.
Potter's movements this evening...

1906
03:02:14,632 --> 03:02:18,469
...I invite them to step forward...

1907
03:02:22,014 --> 03:02:23,724
...now.

1908
03:02:38,364 --> 03:02:42,284
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

1909
03:02:42,451 --> 03:02:45,204
...you still have a bit of a
security problem, headmaster.

1910
03:02:48,624 --> 03:02:51,627
And I'm afraid it's
quite extensive.

1911
03:02:52,336 --> 03:02:54,463
How dare you stand where he stood?

1912
03:02:56,048 --> 03:02:58,175
Tell them how it
happened that night.

1913
03:02:58,342 --> 03:03:02,888
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

1914
03:03:03,305 --> 03:03:04,932
Tell them.

1915
03:03:29,790 --> 03:03:30,833
Coward!

1916
03:03:39,883 --> 03:03:42,386
Harry.

1917
03:03:43,470 --> 03:03:44,680
Potter?

1918
03:04:19,298 --> 03:04:24,887
I know that many of you
will want to fight.

1919
03:04:25,054 --> 03:04:30,058
Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.

1920
03:04:30,476 --> 03:04:33,562
But this is folly.

1921
03:04:34,021 --> 03:04:36,857
Give me Harry Potter.

1922
03:04:37,816 --> 03:04:41,987
Do this and none shall be harmed.

1923
03:04:42,154 --> 03:04:48,202
Give me Harry Potter and I
shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

1924
03:04:48,368 --> 03:04:51,288
Give me Harry Potter...

1925
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:55,417
...and you will be rewarded.

1926
03:04:55,584 --> 03:04:59,171
You have one hour.

1927
03:05:08,931 --> 03:05:10,891
What are you waiting for?

1928
03:05:11,058 --> 03:05:12,392
Someone grab him.

1929
03:05:21,318 --> 03:05:23,237
Students out of bed.

1930
03:05:24,029 --> 03:05:26,281
Students out of bed!

1931
03:05:26,490 --> 03:05:28,033
Students in the corridor!

1932
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:31,620
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

1933
03:05:32,996 --> 03:05:34,456
Oh.

1934
03:05:34,998 --> 03:05:36,083
Sorry, ma'am.

1935
03:05:36,208 --> 03:05:40,129
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

1936
03:05:40,295 --> 03:05:42,589
If you would,
I would like you, please...

1937
03:05:42,756 --> 03:05:47,261
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the
rest of Slytherin House from the hall.

1938
03:05:47,261 --> 03:05:50,013
Exactly where is it I'll
be leading them to, ma'am?

1939
03:05:50,013 --> 03:05:52,766
The dungeons would do.

1940
03:05:54,852 --> 03:05:57,563
Right. Come on. Come on.

1941
03:05:57,563 --> 03:06:01,191
I presume you have a reason for
returning, Potter. What is it you need?

1942
03:06:01,191 --> 03:06:03,777
Time, professor. As much
as you can get me.

1943
03:06:04,361 --> 03:06:07,948
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

1944
03:06:08,824 --> 03:06:10,409
Potter.

1945
03:06:12,327 --> 03:06:14,121
It's good to see you.

1946
03:06:15,038 --> 03:06:17,374
It's good to see you too,
professor.

1947
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,210
Hold the fort, Neville.

1948
03:06:23,547 --> 03:06:25,507
Hurry up, come on!

1949
03:06:31,722 --> 03:06:34,266
Harry. Hermione and
I have been thinking.

1950
03:06:34,433 --> 03:06:36,393
It doesn't matter if
we find a Horcrux.

1951
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:38,770
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

1952
03:06:38,854 --> 03:06:40,230
So we were thinking...

1953
03:06:40,397 --> 03:06:42,900
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

1954
03:06:43,066 --> 03:06:46,236
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

1955
03:06:46,361 --> 03:06:48,572
Me and Hermione know
where we might find one.

1956
03:06:48,697 --> 03:06:50,532
Okay.

1957
03:06:50,699 --> 03:06:54,411
Okay, but take this. That way you
can find me when you get back.

1958
03:06:54,411 --> 03:06:56,830
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

1959
03:06:56,830 --> 03:06:58,373
Gotta start somewhere.

1960
03:07:04,421 --> 03:07:06,173
Harry.

1961
03:07:06,340 --> 03:07:07,883
Harry!

1962
03:07:08,050 --> 03:07:09,551
Let me get this straight.

1963
03:07:09,718 --> 03:07:13,680
- You're giving us permission to do this?
- That is correct, Longbottom.

1964
03:07:13,847 --> 03:07:15,265
To blow it up? Boom?

1965
03:07:15,432 --> 03:07:16,934
Boom!

1966
03:07:17,100 --> 03:07:20,520
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

1967
03:07:20,687 --> 03:07:23,023
Why don't you confer
with Mr. Finnigan?

1968
03:07:23,190 --> 03:07:26,735
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyrotechnics.

1969
03:07:26,944 --> 03:07:27,986
I can bring it down.

1970
03:07:28,111 --> 03:07:30,489
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

1971
03:07:30,489 --> 03:07:34,910
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

1972
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:38,080
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

1973
03:07:38,747 --> 03:07:43,252
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

1974
03:07:43,418 --> 03:07:46,296
He's going to try to
kill you either way.

1975
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:51,885
Piertotum Locomotor.

1976
03:08:07,442 --> 03:08:09,236
Hogwarts is threatened.

1977
03:08:09,403 --> 03:08:15,617
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

1978
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:22,332
I've always wanted
to use that spell.

1979
03:08:31,174 --> 03:08:34,177
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

1980
03:08:34,344 --> 03:08:38,974
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

1981
03:08:39,141 --> 03:08:43,895
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

1982
03:08:44,062 --> 03:08:45,731
Protego Maxima.

1983
03:09:13,925 --> 03:09:18,346
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

1984
03:09:18,346 --> 03:09:21,308
You won't find anything where
you're going. You're wasting time.

1985
03:09:21,308 --> 03:09:23,477
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

1986
03:09:23,477 --> 03:09:24,895
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

1987
03:09:25,062 --> 03:09:26,980
You listen to me right now!

1988
03:09:28,482 --> 03:09:31,902
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

1989
03:09:32,027 --> 03:09:34,946
"There's not a person alive who's seen it."

1990
03:09:35,113 --> 03:09:39,826
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

1991
03:09:50,212 --> 03:09:53,006
It's very impressive, isn't it?

1992
03:10:08,355 --> 03:10:10,982
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

1993
03:10:11,149 --> 03:10:12,609
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

1994
03:10:12,776 --> 03:10:15,237
I think it's best if
you two talk alone.

1995
03:10:15,445 --> 03:10:17,614
She's very shy.

1996
03:10:44,141 --> 03:10:45,684
You're the Grey Lady...

1997
03:10:46,476 --> 03:10:48,228
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

1998
03:10:48,395 --> 03:10:50,105
I do not answer to that name.

1999
03:10:50,313 --> 03:10:54,860
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

2000
03:10:55,026 --> 03:10:57,154
Rowena's daughter.

2001
03:10:57,320 --> 03:10:59,364
Are you a friend of Luna's?

2002
03:10:59,531 --> 03:11:01,491
Yes.

2003
03:11:01,658 --> 03:11:04,119
And she thought you might
be able to help me.

2004
03:11:05,996 --> 03:11:08,623
You seek my mother's diadem.

2005
03:11:10,125 --> 03:11:11,793
Yes.

2006
03:11:12,711 --> 03:11:13,795
That's right.

2007
03:11:15,505 --> 03:11:20,177
Luna is kind, unlike
so many of the others.

2008
03:11:20,343 --> 03:11:23,430
But she was wrong.
I cannot help you.

2009
03:11:28,059 --> 03:11:30,520
Wait. Please.

2010
03:11:32,189 --> 03:11:34,232
I want to destroy it.

2011
03:12:12,229 --> 03:12:14,731
They never learn.

2012
03:12:15,857 --> 03:12:17,901
Such a pity.

2013
03:12:18,193 --> 03:12:21,530
But, my Lord...

2014
03:12:21,696 --> 03:12:23,949
...shouldn't we wait for...?

2015
03:12:24,115 --> 03:12:25,867
My Lord.

2016
03:12:31,039 --> 03:12:32,499
Begin.

2017
03:12:53,103 --> 03:12:55,438
That's what you want
too, isn't it, Helena?

2018
03:13:01,027 --> 03:13:02,279
You want it destroyed.

2019
03:13:02,445 --> 03:13:05,490
Another swore to destroy
it many years ago...

2020
03:13:05,657 --> 03:13:08,535
...a strange boy
with a strange name.

2021
03:13:08,702 --> 03:13:11,538
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

2022
03:13:11,705 --> 03:13:12,914
He's lied to many people.

2023
03:13:13,039 --> 03:13:16,167
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

2024
03:13:16,334 --> 03:13:19,254
He defiled it with dark magic!

2025
03:13:34,227 --> 03:13:37,939
I can destroy it once and for all.

2026
03:13:39,899 --> 03:13:42,861
But only if you tell
me where he hid it.

2027
03:13:44,821 --> 03:13:50,619
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

2028
03:13:52,162 --> 03:13:54,622
You just have to tell me.

2029
03:13:56,124 --> 03:13:57,876
Please.

2030
03:14:09,638 --> 03:14:11,931
Strange.

2031
03:14:14,809 --> 03:14:17,896
You remind me of him a bit.

2032
03:14:19,105 --> 03:14:20,357
It's here...

2033
03:14:21,024 --> 03:14:25,320
...in the castle, in the place
where everything is hidden.

2034
03:14:27,530 --> 03:14:28,907
If you have to ask...

2035
03:14:29,074 --> 03:14:31,368
...you will never know.

2036
03:14:32,369 --> 03:14:36,331
If you know, you need only ask.

2037
03:14:37,499 --> 03:14:39,167
Thank you.

2038
03:14:51,930 --> 03:14:56,226
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and
I will handle this side of the castle.

2039
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:58,812
Yes, sir.

2040
03:15:02,232 --> 03:15:05,360
Hey, Dean, on second thought,
tell Professor McGonagall...

2041
03:15:05,527 --> 03:15:08,321
...we might need one or
two more wands this side.

2042
03:15:08,321 --> 03:15:13,993
It is the quality of one's convictions
that determines success...

2043
03:15:13,993 --> 03:15:15,745
...not the number of followers.

2044
03:15:15,912 --> 03:15:17,914
Who said that?

2045
03:15:18,373 --> 03:15:19,916
Me.

2046
03:15:26,715 --> 03:15:28,508
You shouldn't have.

2047
03:15:28,508 --> 03:15:29,968
It's Teddy who needs you.

2048
03:15:29,968 --> 03:15:33,096
He'll sleep til dawn and snore like his father.

2049
03:15:34,305 --> 03:15:36,516
It's you that needs me tonight.

2050
03:15:40,937 --> 03:15:42,856
You okay, Freddie?

2051
03:15:43,231 --> 03:15:44,649
Yeah.

2052
03:15:46,109 --> 03:15:47,819
Me too.

2053
03:16:04,919 --> 03:16:08,548
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?

2054
03:16:09,424 --> 03:16:11,426
No, of course not.

2055
03:17:21,496 --> 03:17:25,041
Yeah! You and whose army?

2056
03:17:45,395 --> 03:17:47,021
- You do it.
- I can't.

2057
03:17:47,230 --> 03:17:49,315
Yes, you can.

2058
03:20:47,410 --> 03:20:49,037
Neville!

2059
03:21:06,220 --> 03:21:08,097
That went well.

2060
03:21:54,268 --> 03:21:58,314
Get inside! This way,
everyone. Take cover!

2061
03:22:15,998 --> 03:22:17,834
Stupefy!

2062
03:22:19,168 --> 03:22:20,670
Get your coat on!

2063
03:22:20,837 --> 03:22:23,965
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

2064
03:22:24,131 --> 03:22:28,636
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire.
You haven't seen Luna, have you?

2065
03:22:28,845 --> 03:22:30,680
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

2066
03:22:30,847 --> 03:22:35,143
I think it's about time I told her since
we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

2067
03:22:39,105 --> 03:22:40,857
I know.

2068
03:22:42,900 --> 03:22:45,278
Nighty night.

2069
03:22:46,571 --> 03:22:49,031
Let us out of here, you flithy squib!

2070
03:22:55,872 --> 03:22:58,875
[SLYTHERINS SCREAMING]

2071
03:23:32,408 --> 03:23:34,994
Bloody hell. We'll
never find it on this.

2072
03:23:35,202 --> 03:23:37,830
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

2073
03:23:38,039 --> 03:23:41,292
He just vanished.
Just now. I saw it.

2074
03:23:44,462 --> 03:23:46,547
Maybe he's gone to
the Room of Requirement.

2075
03:23:46,589 --> 03:23:50,051
It doesn't show up on the map,
does it? You said that last year.

2076
03:23:50,218 --> 03:23:52,553
That's right. I... I did.

2077
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:54,430
Let's go.

2078
03:23:55,139 --> 03:23:56,891
Brilliant.

2079
03:24:02,480 --> 03:24:04,148
Come on!

2080
03:25:56,052 --> 03:25:57,386
Well, well.

2081
03:25:58,345 --> 03:26:00,431
What brings you here, Potter?

2082
03:26:01,265 --> 03:26:03,142
I could ask you the same.

2083
03:26:03,726 --> 03:26:05,811
You have something of mine.

2084
03:26:06,687 --> 03:26:08,189
I'd like it back.

2085
03:26:08,189 --> 03:26:10,900
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It's my mother's.

2086
03:26:10,900 --> 03:26:14,779
It's powerful,
but it's not the same.

2087
03:26:14,945 --> 03:26:18,574
Doesn't quite understand me.

2088
03:26:19,075 --> 03:26:20,534
Know what I mean?

2089
03:26:21,160 --> 03:26:23,079
Why didn't you tell her?

2090
03:26:24,747 --> 03:26:25,956
Bellatrix.

2091
03:26:29,377 --> 03:26:31,295
You knew it was me.

2092
03:26:32,046 --> 03:26:33,547
You didn't say anything.

2093
03:26:33,714 --> 03:26:35,591
Come on, Draco.

2094
03:26:35,758 --> 03:26:38,928
Don't be a prat. Do him.

2095
03:26:39,720 --> 03:26:41,055
Easy.

2096
03:26:42,473 --> 03:26:43,766
Expelliarmus.

2097
03:26:43,933 --> 03:26:44,975
Avada Kedavra!

2098
03:26:45,142 --> 03:26:46,185
Stupefy!

2099
03:26:50,648 --> 03:26:53,692
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

2100
03:27:15,256 --> 03:27:16,882
Got it.

2101
03:27:23,681 --> 03:27:25,057
Run!

2102
03:27:26,267 --> 03:27:27,476
Run!

2103
03:27:31,522 --> 03:27:34,400
Goyle's setting the
bloody place on fire!

2104
03:28:41,383 --> 03:28:43,302
Come on! This way!

2105
03:28:50,601 --> 03:28:52,603
We can't leave them.

2106
03:28:52,770 --> 03:28:54,939
He's joking, right?

2107
03:29:03,614 --> 03:29:06,450
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

2108
03:29:29,139 --> 03:29:30,808
Harry!

2109
03:30:17,271 --> 03:30:18,564
My Lord?

2110
03:30:18,731 --> 03:30:21,233
Avada Kedavra!

2111
03:30:27,614 --> 03:30:31,869
Come, Nagini.
I need to keep you safe.

2112
03:30:44,256 --> 03:30:46,091
It's the snake.

2113
03:30:46,258 --> 03:30:49,845
She's the last one.
It's the last Horcrux.

2114
03:30:56,518 --> 03:30:58,937
Look inside him, Harry.

2115
03:30:59,104 --> 03:31:02,858
Find out where he is. If we
find him, we can find the snake.

2116
03:31:03,025 --> 03:31:05,152
Then we can end this.

2117
03:31:32,846 --> 03:31:34,598
My Lord?

2118
03:31:34,765 --> 03:31:38,644
Might it be less, uh...

2119
03:31:39,395 --> 03:31:43,691
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

2120
03:31:44,441 --> 03:31:46,777
...and simply seek
the boy yourself?

2121
03:31:46,944 --> 03:31:50,280
I do not need to seek the boy.

2122
03:31:50,447 --> 03:31:54,868
Before the night is out, he will
come to me. Do you understand?

2123
03:31:56,787 --> 03:31:58,789
Look at me.

2124
03:31:58,956 --> 03:32:02,918
How can you live with
yourself, Lucius?

2125
03:32:03,085 --> 03:32:04,878
I don't know.

2126
03:32:06,964 --> 03:32:09,508
Go and find Severus.

2127
03:32:10,092 --> 03:32:12,177
Bring him to me.

2128
03:32:20,185 --> 03:32:22,187
I know where he is.

2129
03:32:31,905 --> 03:32:33,991
Come on!

2130
03:33:14,031 --> 03:33:16,158
Crucio!

2131
03:33:21,914 --> 03:33:23,332
No!

2132
03:34:09,503 --> 03:34:12,756
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

2133
03:34:12,881 --> 03:34:14,925
...in the last few hours alone.

2134
03:34:15,092 --> 03:34:16,843
No.

2135
03:34:17,344 --> 03:34:20,597
No, I am extraordinary...

2136
03:34:20,764 --> 03:34:24,393
...but the wand resists me.

2137
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:27,646
There is no wand more powerful.

2138
03:34:27,813 --> 03:34:30,607
Ollivander himself has said it.

2139
03:34:30,774 --> 03:34:36,405
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

2140
03:34:38,448 --> 03:34:41,285
It answers to you...

2141
03:34:42,160 --> 03:34:44,496
...and you only.

2142
03:34:45,205 --> 03:34:46,707
Does it?

2143
03:34:49,710 --> 03:34:51,253
My Lord?

2144
03:34:53,547 --> 03:34:57,885
The wand, does it
truly answer to me?

2145
03:34:59,678 --> 03:35:01,763
You're a clever man, Severus.

2146
03:35:01,930 --> 03:35:03,849
Surely you must know.

2147
03:35:05,517 --> 03:35:09,229
Where does its true loyalty lie?

2148
03:35:09,730 --> 03:35:11,481
With you...

2149
03:35:12,024 --> 03:35:14,109
...of course, my Lord.

2150
03:35:14,276 --> 03:35:15,485
The Elder Wand...

2151
03:35:16,278 --> 03:35:22,075
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

2152
03:35:23,201 --> 03:35:28,665
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

2153
03:35:34,588 --> 03:35:38,258
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

2154
03:35:39,134 --> 03:35:44,389
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

2155
03:35:45,891 --> 03:35:49,603
You've been a good and
faithful servant, Severus...

2156
03:35:50,103 --> 03:35:55,192
...but only I can live forever.

2157
03:35:58,487 --> 03:35:59,529
My Lord...

2158
03:36:05,535 --> 03:36:07,621
Nagini, kill.

2159
03:37:08,432 --> 03:37:10,392
Take them.

2160
03:37:11,560 --> 03:37:13,478
Take them.

2161
03:37:14,312 --> 03:37:15,814
Please.

2162
03:37:15,981 --> 03:37:19,651
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

2163
03:37:38,003 --> 03:37:39,463
Take them to the Pensieve.

2164
03:37:43,008 --> 03:37:45,010
Look at me.

2165
03:37:50,724 --> 03:37:53,477
You have your mother's eyes.

2166
03:38:27,135 --> 03:38:30,680
You have fought valiantly...

2167
03:38:32,099 --> 03:38:34,851
...but in vain.

2168
03:38:38,146 --> 03:38:40,398
I do not wish this.

2169
03:38:40,565 --> 03:38:46,112
Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.

2170
03:38:46,279 --> 03:38:51,034
I therefore command
my forces to retreat.

2171
03:38:51,243 --> 03:38:56,748
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.

2172
03:38:57,249 --> 03:39:03,296
Harry Potter, I now
speak directly to you.

2173
03:39:03,463 --> 03:39:08,844
On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...

2174
03:39:09,010 --> 03:39:11,513
...rather than face me yourself.

2175
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:15,225
There is no greater dishonor.

2176
03:39:15,433 --> 03:39:20,355
Join me in the Forbidden
Forest and confront your fate.

2177
03:39:21,606 --> 03:39:24,234
If you do not do this...

2178
03:39:24,401 --> 03:39:31,074
...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...

2179
03:39:31,283 --> 03:39:35,829
...who tries to
conceal you from me.

2180
03:39:55,390 --> 03:39:57,309
Where is everybody?

2181
03:40:22,125 --> 03:40:23,168
Harry.

2182
03:40:28,840 --> 03:40:31,593
Oh, come on. What's
the matter with you?

2183
03:40:31,760 --> 03:40:33,386
Oh, she's passed.

2184
03:40:35,180 --> 03:40:37,682
There, she's gone.

2185
03:42:46,436 --> 03:42:47,479
Freak!

2186
03:42:47,645 --> 03:42:49,105
Come here.

2187
03:42:49,314 --> 03:42:51,358
I'm gonna tell Mummy.
You're a freak.

2188
03:42:51,524 --> 03:42:53,985
You're a freak, Lily!

2189
03:42:54,152 --> 03:42:55,737
Come here.

2190
03:43:16,716 --> 03:43:20,011
She's jealous because she's
ordinary and you're special.

2191
03:43:20,178 --> 03:43:22,722
That's mean, Severus.

2192
03:43:45,537 --> 03:43:47,622
Gryffindor!

2193
03:43:55,171 --> 03:43:58,091
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

2194
03:44:02,679 --> 03:44:06,808
Just like your father.
Lazy. Arrogant.

2195
03:44:06,975 --> 03:44:08,810
Don't say a word against my father.

2196
03:44:15,108 --> 03:44:16,693
Blood shall be spilt...

2197
03:44:16,901 --> 03:44:21,865
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

2198
03:44:22,073 --> 03:44:23,950
Severus.

2199
03:44:25,034 --> 03:44:27,036
No. Don't kill me.

2200
03:44:27,203 --> 03:44:31,040
The prophecy did not
refer to a woman.

2201
03:44:31,207 --> 03:44:33,459
It spoke of a boy born
at the end of July.

2202
03:44:33,626 --> 03:44:35,879
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

2203
03:44:36,462 --> 03:44:39,632
He intends to hunt them
down now, to kill them.

2204
03:44:39,799 --> 03:44:44,304
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

2205
03:44:44,470 --> 03:44:47,557
What will you give me
in exchange, Severus?

2206
03:44:49,309 --> 03:44:50,351
Anything.

2207
03:44:50,518 --> 03:44:55,231
Harry. Harry, you are
so loved. So loved.

2208
03:44:56,274 --> 03:44:58,902
Harry, Mama loves you.

2209
03:44:59,110 --> 03:45:01,988
Dada loves you.

2210
03:45:02,864 --> 03:45:05,033
Harry, be safe.

2211
03:45:05,200 --> 03:45:06,242
Be strong.

2212
03:45:06,409 --> 03:45:07,869
Avada Kedavra!

2213
03:45:12,415 --> 03:45:16,878
You said you would keep her safe.

2214
03:45:17,045 --> 03:45:21,090
Lily and James put their faith
in the wrong person, Severus.

2215
03:45:22,050 --> 03:45:24,093
Rather like you.

2216
03:45:26,262 --> 03:45:27,722
The boy survives.

2217
03:45:27,722 --> 03:45:30,308
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

2218
03:45:30,308 --> 03:45:32,560
The Dark Lord will return.

2219
03:45:32,727 --> 03:45:36,272
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger.

2220
03:45:37,482 --> 03:45:39,817
He has her eyes.

2221
03:45:43,321 --> 03:45:46,449
If you truly loved her...

2222
03:45:49,160 --> 03:45:52,997
No one can know.

2223
03:45:53,164 --> 03:45:55,833
That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?

2224
03:45:55,833 --> 03:45:56,918
Your word.

2225
03:45:57,043 --> 03:45:59,963
When you risk your life every
day to protect the boy?

2226
03:45:59,963 --> 03:46:03,841
He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...

2227
03:46:03,841 --> 03:46:05,718
...and he seems to relish his fame.

2228
03:46:05,885 --> 03:46:08,763
Don't say a word against my father.

2229
03:46:08,930 --> 03:46:11,140
James Potter?

2230
03:46:11,307 --> 03:46:12,809
Lazy, arrogant.

2231
03:46:12,976 --> 03:46:14,310
My father was a great man.

2232
03:46:14,477 --> 03:46:16,354
Your father was a swine!

2233
03:46:18,189 --> 03:46:19,857
Drink the rest.

2234
03:46:20,024 --> 03:46:24,070
It will contain the curse to
your hand for the time being.

2235
03:46:24,237 --> 03:46:26,197
It will spread, Albus.

2236
03:46:26,364 --> 03:46:28,032
How long?

2237
03:46:29,033 --> 03:46:31,494
Maybe a year.

2238
03:46:33,705 --> 03:46:34,956
Don't ignore me, Severus.

2239
03:46:35,039 --> 03:46:36,499
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

2240
03:46:36,708 --> 03:46:40,628
We both know Lord Voldemort has
ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

2241
03:46:42,714 --> 03:46:46,968
But should he fail, one
should presume the Dark Lord...

2242
03:46:47,135 --> 03:46:49,262
...will turn to you.

2243
03:46:52,015 --> 03:46:55,935
You must be the one
to kill me, Severus.

2244
03:46:56,102 --> 03:46:58,271
It is the only way.

2245
03:46:59,230 --> 03:47:03,610
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.

2246
03:47:03,776 --> 03:47:06,446
Avada Kedavra.

2247
03:47:09,699 --> 03:47:14,620
There will come a time when Harry
Potter must be told something.

2248
03:47:16,205 --> 03:47:21,377
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

2249
03:47:21,586 --> 03:47:24,464
Must be told what?

2250
03:47:24,630 --> 03:47:26,674
On the night Lord Voldemort...

2251
03:47:26,841 --> 03:47:30,053
...went to Godric's
Hollow to kill Harry...

2252
03:47:31,054 --> 03:47:33,765
...and Lily Potter cast
herself between them...

2253
03:47:34,557 --> 03:47:36,476
... the curse rebounded.

2254
03:47:38,269 --> 03:47:41,898
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

2255
03:47:42,106 --> 03:47:46,944
... latched itself onto the
only living thing it could find:

2256
03:47:47,111 --> 03:47:49,238
Harry himself.

2257
03:47:50,573 --> 03:47:53,993
There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes.

2258
03:47:54,577 --> 03:47:57,413
There's a reason he can look
into Lord Voldemort's mind.

2259
03:47:59,791 --> 03:48:05,838
A part of Voldemort
lives inside him.

2260
03:48:12,303 --> 03:48:15,223
So when the time comes...

2261
03:48:16,140 --> 03:48:18,267
...the boy must die?

2262
03:48:20,186 --> 03:48:22,230
Yes. Yes.

2263
03:48:22,397 --> 03:48:24,649
He must die.

2264
03:48:42,959 --> 03:48:47,839
You've kept him alive so that
he can die at the proper moment.

2265
03:48:51,467 --> 03:48:55,054
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

2266
03:48:55,221 --> 03:48:59,642
Don't tell me now that you've
grown to care for the boy?

2267
03:49:04,147 --> 03:49:07,400
Expecto Patronum.

2268
03:49:18,327 --> 03:49:19,829
Lily.

2269
03:49:23,082 --> 03:49:25,460
After all this time?

2270
03:49:28,880 --> 03:49:31,007
Always.

2271
03:49:36,137 --> 03:49:39,140
So when the time comes...

2272
03:49:39,307 --> 03:49:42,310
...the boy must die?

2273
03:49:42,477 --> 03:49:45,855
Yes. He must die.

2274
03:49:46,022 --> 03:49:49,025
And Voldemort himself must do it.

2275
03:49:49,442 --> 03:49:51,652
That is essential.

2276
03:50:56,676 --> 03:50:57,760
Where've you been?

2277
03:50:57,927 --> 03:51:01,097
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

2278
03:51:01,264 --> 03:51:04,225
Are you mad? No.

2279
03:51:04,976 --> 03:51:07,436
You can't give yourself up to him.

2280
03:51:10,815 --> 03:51:12,692
What is it, Harry?

2281
03:51:14,235 --> 03:51:16,153
What is it you know?

2282
03:51:18,948 --> 03:51:21,534
There's a reason I can hear them...

2283
03:51:22,159 --> 03:51:23,369
...the Horcruxes.

2284
03:51:25,871 --> 03:51:28,249
I think I've known for a while.

2285
03:51:29,667 --> 03:51:31,961
And I think you have too.

2286
03:51:34,922 --> 03:51:38,092
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

2287
03:51:38,843 --> 03:51:40,970
Kill the snake and
then it's just him.

2288
03:53:01,175 --> 03:53:03,219
I'm ready to die.

2289
03:53:44,510 --> 03:53:46,971
The Resurrection Stone.

2290
03:54:16,625 --> 03:54:20,004
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

2291
03:54:24,091 --> 03:54:25,968
Why are you here?

2292
03:54:26,761 --> 03:54:28,554
All of you?

2293
03:54:30,931 --> 03:54:33,100
We never left.

2294
03:54:41,984 --> 03:54:43,569
Does it...?

2295
03:54:44,320 --> 03:54:45,488
Does it hurt?

2296
03:54:46,530 --> 03:54:48,240
Dying?

2297
03:54:49,200 --> 03:54:51,702
Quicker than falling asleep.

2298
03:54:55,623 --> 03:54:57,917
You're nearly there, son.

2299
03:54:58,084 --> 03:54:59,293
I'm sorry.

2300
03:54:59,460 --> 03:55:02,963
I never wanted any
of you to die for me.

2301
03:55:04,548 --> 03:55:06,175
And, Remus, your son...

2302
03:55:06,342 --> 03:55:10,596
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

2303
03:55:10,763 --> 03:55:14,225
One day, he'll understand.

2304
03:55:25,986 --> 03:55:27,530
You'll stay with me?

2305
03:55:29,073 --> 03:55:31,367
Until the end.

2306
03:55:32,076 --> 03:55:34,036
And he won't be able to see you?

2307
03:55:34,203 --> 03:55:35,871
No.

2308
03:55:37,164 --> 03:55:39,750
We're here, you see.

2309
03:55:54,306 --> 03:55:56,350
Stay close to me.

2310
03:55:58,102 --> 03:56:00,229
Always.

2311
03:56:14,994 --> 03:56:18,747
No sign of him, my Lord.

2312
03:56:34,180 --> 03:56:36,932
I thought he would come.

2313
03:57:17,806 --> 03:57:21,477
Harry? No! What
are you doing here?

2314
03:57:21,644 --> 03:57:22,937
Quiet!

2315
03:57:33,948 --> 03:57:36,200
Harry Potter.

2316
03:57:39,328 --> 03:57:41,997
The Boy Who Lived.

2317
03:57:46,252 --> 03:57:48,712
Come to die.

2318
03:58:06,897 --> 03:58:08,607
Avada Kedavra!

2319
03:59:05,289 --> 03:59:06,707
You can't help.

2320
03:59:07,624 --> 03:59:08,709
Harry...

2321
03:59:09,293 --> 03:59:11,545
...you wonderful boy.

2322
03:59:12,046 --> 03:59:15,966
You brave, brave man.

2323
03:59:17,926 --> 03:59:19,887
Let us walk.

2324
03:59:27,352 --> 03:59:29,605
Professor, what is that?

2325
03:59:32,316 --> 03:59:35,319
Something beyond
either of our help.

2326
03:59:38,197 --> 03:59:41,450
A part of Voldemort
sent here to die.

2327
03:59:41,825 --> 03:59:43,118
And exactly where are we?

2328
03:59:44,328 --> 03:59:48,248
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

2329
03:59:48,457 --> 03:59:50,167
Well...

2330
03:59:50,334 --> 03:59:52,961
... it looks like King's Cross station.

2331
03:59:53,337 --> 03:59:55,631
Only cleaner.

2332
03:59:55,798 --> 03:59:58,008
And without all the trains.

2333
03:59:58,550 --> 04:00:01,303
King's Cross, is that right?

2334
04:00:01,678 --> 04:00:05,224
This is, as they say, your party.

2335
04:00:06,391 --> 04:00:09,395
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

2336
04:00:09,561 --> 04:00:12,397
... have been connected by
something other than fate...

2337
04:00:12,564 --> 04:00:15,609
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.

2338
04:00:15,776 --> 04:00:17,486
So it's true then, sir?

2339
04:00:17,694 --> 04:00:20,656
A part of him lives
within me, doesn't it?

2340
04:00:20,989 --> 04:00:22,032
Did.

2341
04:00:22,199 --> 04:00:26,995
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

2342
04:00:28,038 --> 04:00:32,751
You were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

2343
04:00:45,305 --> 04:00:46,849
I have to go back, haven't l?

2344
04:00:47,015 --> 04:00:48,892
Oh. That's up to you.

2345
04:00:49,059 --> 04:00:50,853
I have a choice?

2346
04:00:51,019 --> 04:00:52,813
Oh, yes.

2347
04:00:52,980 --> 04:00:55,816
We're in King's Cross, you say?

2348
04:00:56,900 --> 04:01:01,738
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

2349
04:01:03,115 --> 04:01:04,450
And where would it take me?

2350
04:01:06,034 --> 04:01:07,870
On.

2351
04:01:25,846 --> 04:01:27,931
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

2352
04:01:30,601 --> 04:01:31,643
True.

2353
04:01:31,768 --> 04:01:34,563
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

2354
04:01:34,771 --> 04:01:37,316
And I've nothing to kill it with.

2355
04:01:37,858 --> 04:01:42,571
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

2356
04:01:43,780 --> 04:01:47,493
I've always prized myself on
my ability to turn a phrase.

2357
04:01:48,452 --> 04:01:51,580
Words are, in my not
so humble opinion...

2358
04:01:51,747 --> 04:01:55,334
...our most inexhaustible
source of magic...

2359
04:01:55,501 --> 04:01:59,838
...capable of both inflicting
injury and remedying it.

2360
04:02:00,464 --> 04:02:06,386
But I would, in this case, amend
my original statement to this:

2361
04:02:09,181 --> 04:02:15,354
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who deserve it.

2362
04:02:21,193 --> 04:02:23,946
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

2363
04:02:24,404 --> 04:02:26,448
Pity the living.

2364
04:02:26,990 --> 04:02:31,870
And, above all, all those
who live without love.

2365
04:02:32,829 --> 04:02:38,252
Professor, my mother's
Patronus was a doe, wasn't it?

2366
04:02:39,336 --> 04:02:41,922
That's the same as
Professor Snape's.

2367
04:02:42,798 --> 04:02:44,883
It's curious, don't you think?

2368
04:02:45,050 --> 04:02:50,013
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

2369
04:02:51,723 --> 04:02:53,892
I'll be going now, Harry.

2370
04:02:54,434 --> 04:02:55,769
Professor?

2371
04:03:00,274 --> 04:03:02,442
Is this all real?

2372
04:03:03,110 --> 04:03:05,112
Or is it just happening
inside my head?

2373
04:03:05,112 --> 04:03:08,657
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

2374
04:03:08,824 --> 04:03:12,577
Why should that mean
that it's not real?

2375
04:03:18,166 --> 04:03:21,753
Professor? What should I do?

2376
04:03:25,549 --> 04:03:27,301
Professor?

2377
04:03:30,637 --> 04:03:31,930
My Lord?

2378
04:03:32,097 --> 04:03:34,224
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

2379
04:03:34,391 --> 04:03:36,018
I don't need your help.

2380
04:03:36,226 --> 04:03:38,895
No. Come.

2381
04:03:47,612 --> 04:03:49,448
The boy.

2382
04:03:49,614 --> 04:03:51,575
Is he dead?

2383
04:04:05,630 --> 04:04:07,841
Is he alive?

2384
04:04:08,008 --> 04:04:10,218
Draco, is he alive?

2385
04:04:36,870 --> 04:04:38,789
Dead.

2386
04:06:05,542 --> 04:06:08,170
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

2387
04:06:08,879 --> 04:06:10,672
Neville, who is it?

2388
04:06:11,381 --> 04:06:13,842
Harry Potter...

2389
04:06:15,010 --> 04:06:16,511
...is dead.

2390
04:06:16,678 --> 04:06:18,221
No! No!

2391
04:06:18,388 --> 04:06:19,764
Silence.

2392
04:06:23,560 --> 04:06:25,562
Stupid girl.

2393
04:06:26,730 --> 04:06:30,150
Harry Potter is dead.

2394
04:06:30,317 --> 04:06:35,447
From this day forth,
you put your faith...

2395
04:06:35,614 --> 04:06:36,698
...in me.

2396
04:06:47,167 --> 04:06:49,503
Harry Potter is dead!

2397
04:06:54,341 --> 04:06:57,802
And now is the time
to declare yourself.

2398
04:06:59,387 --> 04:07:02,098
Come forward and join us.

2399
04:07:04,059 --> 04:07:05,727
Or die.

2400
04:07:11,274 --> 04:07:12,359
Draco.

2401
04:07:17,989 --> 04:07:19,866
Draco.

2402
04:07:22,786 --> 04:07:24,663
Draco...

2403
04:07:27,499 --> 04:07:29,417
...come.

2404
04:07:40,387 --> 04:07:43,807
Ah. Well done, Draco.

2405
04:07:44,641 --> 04:07:46,476
Well done.

2406
04:08:09,040 --> 04:08:11,793
Well, I must say I'd
hoped for better.

2407
04:08:16,214 --> 04:08:19,134
And who might you
be, young man?

2408
04:08:20,385 --> 04:08:22,345
Neville Longbottom.

2409
04:08:27,642 --> 04:08:31,313
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

2410
04:08:31,521 --> 04:08:33,732
I'd like to say something.

2411
04:08:39,863 --> 04:08:45,660
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

2412
04:08:45,869 --> 04:08:51,333
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

2413
04:08:51,333 --> 04:08:53,918
People die every day.

2414
04:08:55,587 --> 04:08:59,674
Friends, family.

2415
04:09:01,718 --> 04:09:03,261
Yeah.

2416
04:09:04,721 --> 04:09:06,848
We lost Harry tonight.

2417
04:09:08,391 --> 04:09:12,896
But he's still with us, in here.

2418
04:09:13,897 --> 04:09:15,857
So's Fred...

2419
04:09:16,858 --> 04:09:18,610
...and Remus.

2420
04:09:19,736 --> 04:09:21,071
Tonks.

2421
04:09:22,405 --> 04:09:24,282
All of them.

2422
04:09:25,450 --> 04:09:27,702
They didn't die in vain.

2423
04:09:32,874 --> 04:09:33,917
But you will.

2424
04:09:34,084 --> 04:09:36,461
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

2425
04:09:36,628 --> 04:09:39,631
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us.

2426
04:09:39,798 --> 04:09:41,383
This is not over!

2427
04:09:45,512 --> 04:09:47,347
Confringo!

2428
04:09:55,647 --> 04:09:57,232
No! No, come back!

2429
04:09:57,399 --> 04:10:01,319
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!

2430
04:10:01,486 --> 04:10:03,571
Come back!

2431
04:10:08,618 --> 04:10:11,746
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

2432
04:10:11,955 --> 04:10:13,832
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

2433
04:13:07,380 --> 04:13:09,924
Not my daughter, you bitch.

2434
04:13:43,374 --> 04:13:44,709
You were right...

2435
04:13:46,502 --> 04:13:48,796
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

2436
04:13:49,005 --> 04:13:50,632
It will always fail you.

2437
04:13:51,966 --> 04:13:53,509
I killed Snape.

2438
04:13:53,676 --> 04:13:55,970
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

2439
04:13:56,012 --> 04:13:58,848
What if its allegiance was
always to someone else?

2440
04:13:59,015 --> 04:14:02,227
Come on, Tom. Let's finish
this the way we started it.

2441
04:14:02,685 --> 04:14:03,770
Together.

2442
04:17:35,731 --> 04:17:40,403
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.

2443
04:17:40,403 --> 04:17:44,740
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

2444
04:17:44,907 --> 04:17:46,868
It was lost in the
folds of my gowns.

2445
04:17:47,076 --> 04:17:49,871
I managed to find it and I
dispatched a few of them...

2446
04:17:50,037 --> 04:17:51,247
Harry.

2447
04:18:51,724 --> 04:18:55,436
Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?

2448
04:18:56,395 --> 04:18:58,314
It answered to somebody else.

2449
04:18:58,314 --> 04:19:02,235
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

2450
04:19:02,235 --> 04:19:06,405
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

2451
04:19:06,572 --> 04:19:11,077
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

2452
04:19:11,244 --> 04:19:15,289
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

2453
04:19:16,165 --> 04:19:18,000
Until...

2454
04:19:18,167 --> 04:19:22,713
...the other night when I
disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

2455
04:19:22,880 --> 04:19:25,007
So that means...

2456
04:19:26,550 --> 04:19:28,302
It's mine.

2457
04:19:30,471 --> 04:19:31,722
What should we do with it?

2458
04:19:32,181 --> 04:19:33,933
We?

2459
04:19:34,350 --> 04:19:38,563
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

2460
04:19:38,729 --> 04:19:42,692
With that, we'd be invincible.

2461
04:22:05,835 --> 04:22:07,461
Together.

2462
04:22:24,812 --> 04:22:26,981
Look after each other.

2463
04:22:46,167 --> 04:22:47,918
- Bag?
- Yeah.

2464
04:22:48,085 --> 04:22:49,170
Jumper?

2465
04:22:50,838 --> 04:22:52,840
I'll miss you.

2466
04:22:53,924 --> 04:22:55,676
Here they come.

2467
04:23:10,858 --> 04:23:15,029
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

2468
04:23:17,323 --> 04:23:19,867
Albus Severus Potter...

2469
04:23:21,160 --> 04:23:24,872
...you were named after two
headmasters of Hogwarts.

2470
04:23:25,080 --> 04:23:26,665
One of them was a Slytherin...

2471
04:23:26,832 --> 04:23:30,044
...and he was the bravest
man I've ever known.

2472
04:23:31,921 --> 04:23:33,214
But just say that I am.

2473
04:23:33,380 --> 04:23:38,969
Then Slytherin House will have
gained a wonderful young wizard.

2474
04:23:39,136 --> 04:23:44,850
But, listen, if it really means that
much to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

2475
04:23:45,017 --> 04:23:47,937
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

2476
04:23:48,562 --> 04:23:50,564
- Really?
- Really.

2477
04:23:51,941 --> 04:23:54,610
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

2478
04:23:54,777 --> 04:23:55,861
Ready?

2479
04:23:55,986 --> 04:23:57,571
Ready.

2480
04:24:09,792 --> 04:24:11,418
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

2481
04:24:11,627 --> 04:24:13,087
Come on.
