1
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,357
Bloody kids.

2
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,490
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:24,037
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:29,417
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,045
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,504
I only meant...

7
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,633
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,177
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,889
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,725
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,854
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,066
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,485
Send them a sign.

14
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,708
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,545
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:20,051
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,053
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,559
Harry.

19
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,979
Harry!

20
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,065
Are you all right?

21
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,901
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,405
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,823
Last night.

24
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,242
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,660
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,328
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,831
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,334
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,844
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,597
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,266
Keep up!

32
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,687
Arthur!

33
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,856
It's about time, son.

34
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:19,402
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,241
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,952
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,287
Yes, sir.

38
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,122
This way.

39
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,210
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,130
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,090
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,387
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,475
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,809
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:56,147
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,484
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,153
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,654
Time to go!

49
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,448
What's a Portkey?

50
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,660
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,912
...three!

52
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,091
Let go, kids!

53
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,843
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,483
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,028
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,953
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,707
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,380
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,174
Look!

60
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,344
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,644
Blimey!

62
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,688
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,231
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,732
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,568
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,283
Home sweet home.

67
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,619
What?

68
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,920
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,422
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,091
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,094
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,763
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,224
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,603
I love magic.

75
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,330
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,791
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,376
Well, put it this way:

78
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,337
If it rains...

79
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,839
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,009
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,471
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,806
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,100
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,064
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,316
While you can.

86
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:03,376
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,419
Come on!

88
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,632
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,634
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,184
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,650
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,074
Who's that?

93
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,869
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,458
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,423
Krum!

96
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,341
Yes!

97
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,976
Good evening!

98
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,521
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,774
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,154
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:19,201
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,203
Let the match...

103
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,164
...begin!

104
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,464
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,973
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,767
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,978
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,065
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,608
He's an artist.

110
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,943
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,612
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,405
Viktor, I do

113
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,784
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,620
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,538
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,666
It's not the Irish.

117
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,960
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,465
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,968
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,805
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,140
Go!

122
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,142
Harry!

123
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,118
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,496
Harry! Harry!

125
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,670
Morsmordre!

126
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,907
Harry!

127
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,620
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,499
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,418
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,254
What is that?

131
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,426
Stupefy!

132
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,928
Stop!

133
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,305
That's my son!

134
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,017
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,477
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,854
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,981
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,192
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,860
What crime?

140
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,530
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

141
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,864
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,911
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,288
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,374
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,128
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,964
There!

147
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,466
All of you, this way!

148
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,635
A man, Harry?

149
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
Who?

150
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,597
I don't know.

151
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,434
I didn't see his face.

152
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,787
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,916
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,589
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,966
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,926
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,471
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,642
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,313
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,320
Thank you.

161
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,326
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,245
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,456
This is horrible.

165
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,542
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,502
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,464
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,593
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,641
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

170
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,476
I'm fine.

171
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,397
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,568
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,205
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,663
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,838
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,742
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,163
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,499
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,419
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,921
Yes, what is it?

181
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,506
What is it?

182
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,179
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:41,310
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,520
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,148
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,485
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,779
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,407
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,367
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,454
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,539
And trust me when I say...

192
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,709
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:10,339
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,551
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,680
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,778
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,996
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,104
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,107
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,068
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

201
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,718
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,344
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,388
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,732
Albus.

205
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,609
Igor.

206
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,864
Hogwarts, let's entertain our friends
in the best way we can.

207
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,865
All stand.

208
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,618
Maestro, please.

209
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,747
All [SINGING]: Hogwarts, Hogwarts,
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

210
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,125
Teach us something, please.

211
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,836
Whether we be old and bald

212
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,964
Or young with scabby knees

213
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:22,554
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff

214
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,766
For now they're bare and full of air

215
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,810
Dead flies and bits of fluff

216
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,943
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[STUDENTS SINGING IN THE DISTANCE]

217
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,412
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

218
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,123
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

219
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,835
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

220
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,255
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

221
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,049
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

222
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,344
AHHHH!

223
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,515
You idiot!

224
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
Your attention, please!

225
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,026
I'd like to say a few words.

226
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,822
Eternal glory.

227
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,326
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

228
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,706
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

229
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,751
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

230
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,336
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

231
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,674
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

232
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,217
To explain all this...

233
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:46,013
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

234
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,307
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

235
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,449
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

236
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,453
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

237
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,081
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

238
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,918
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

239
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,434
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

240
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,727
Thank you.

241
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,110
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

242
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,530
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

243
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,456
After due consideration...

244
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,501
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

245
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,629
...no student under the age of 17...

246
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,549
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

247
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,427
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

248
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,180
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

249
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,101
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

250
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,914
The Goblet of Fire.

251
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,376
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

252
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,462
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

253
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,715
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

254
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,052
Do not do so lightly.

255
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,014
If chosen, there's no turning back.

256
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:58,145
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

257
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,381
Alastor Moody.

258
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,926
Ex-Auror...

259
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,055
...Ministry malcontent...

260
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,683
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

261
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,313
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

262
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,231
Any questions?

263
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,153
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

264
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,199
...I believe in a practical approach.

265
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:58,079
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

266
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,916
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

267
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,336
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

268
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:08,590
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

269
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,551
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

270
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,180
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

271
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,516
You need to be prepared.

272
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,143
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

273
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,604
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

274
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,774
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

275
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,235
And hear across classrooms!

276
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,115
So which curse shall we see first?

277
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,492
- Weasley!
- Yes?

278
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,993
Stand.

279
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,957
Give us a curse.

280
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,961
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

281
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,796
The lmperius Curse.

282
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,216
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

283
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,344
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

284
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,305
Perhaps this will show you why.

285
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,273
Hello.

286
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,609
Lovely little beauty.

287
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,739
Engorgio.

288
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,783
Imperio!

289
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,623
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

290
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,464
If she bites...

291
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,508
...she's lethal.

292
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,846
What are you laughing at?

293
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,598
Get off!

294
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,811
Talented, isn't she?

295
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,356
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

296
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,735
Drown herself?

297
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,791
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

298
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,962
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

299
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,381
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

300
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,467
But here's the rub:

301
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,803
How do we sort out the liars?

302
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,849
Another, another.

303
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,393
Up, up. Come on.

304
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,103
Longbottom, is it?

305
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,272
Up.

306
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,111
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

307
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,740
There's the...

308
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,909
The Cruciatus Curse.

309
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,912
Correct, correct. Come, come.

310
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,747
Particularly nasty.

311
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,627
The torture curse.

312
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,797
Crucio!

313
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,313
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

314
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,960
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

315
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,713
No?

316
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,050
Avada Kedavra!

317
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,347
The Killing Curse.

318
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,643
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

319
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,563
...and he's sitting in this room.

320
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,929
Brilliant, isn't he?

321
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:29,142
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

322
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,479
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

323
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,231
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

324
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,569
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

325
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,907
Neville?

326
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,533
Son?

327
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,535
You all right?

328
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,873
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

329
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,389
We're gonna be late!

330
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,322
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

331
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,423
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

332
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,260
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

333
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,053
Yeah, rather you than me.

334
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,138
Yes!

335
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,268
Thank you, thank you.

336
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,479
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

337
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,815
It's not going to work.

338
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,527
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

339
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,655
You see this? This is an Age Line.

340
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,615
Dumbledore drew it himself.

341
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,242
So?

342
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,455
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

343
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,625
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

344
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:22,046
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

345
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,800
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

346
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,802
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

347
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,141
- Yes!
- Yes!

348
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,476
Yeah!

349
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,271
Yes!

350
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,189
Ready?

351
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,653
- Yes!
- Yes!

352
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,164
- You said!
- You said!

353
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,543
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

354
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,212
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

355
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,839
Fight! Fight! Fight!

356
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,679
We're "old school," right?

357
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,223
Yeah, but you look older!

358
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,257
Sit down. Please.

359
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,555
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

360
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,849
The champion selection.

361
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,093
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

362
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,445
The champion for Beauxbatons...

363
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,613
...is Fleur Delacour.

364
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,169
The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!

365
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,641
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

366
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,979
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

367
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,483
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

368
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,819
...this vessel of victory...

369
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,197
...the Triwizard Cup!

370
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,646
Harry Potter.

371
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,358
Harry Potter?

372
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,948
No. No.

373
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,741
Harry Potter!

374
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,701
Go on, Harry.

375
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,620
Harry, for goodness sake.

376
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,319
He's a cheat!

377
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,406
He's not even 17 yet!

378
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,770
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

379
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,940
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

380
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,109
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

381
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,444
- Harry.
- I protest!

382
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,487
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

383
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,823
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

384
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,325
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

385
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,411
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

386
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,080
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

387
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,625
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

388
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,961
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

389
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,130
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

390
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,300
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

391
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,637
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

392
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,890
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

393
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,977
Leave this to you, Barty.

394
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,522
The rules are absolute.

395
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,486
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

396
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,198
Mr. Potter has no choice.

397
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,284
He is, as of tonight...

398
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,163
...a Triwizard champion.

399
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,235
This can't go on, Albus.

400
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,405
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

401
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,573
What do you suggest, Minerva?

402
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,827
Put an end to it.

403
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,288
Don't let Potter compete.

404
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,915
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

405
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,918
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

406
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,546
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

407
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,717
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

408
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,804
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

409
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,558
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

410
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,728
...let them unfold.

411
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,063
What...? Do nothing?

412
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,898
Offer him up as bait?

413
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,736
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

414
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,364
I agree. With Severus.

415
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,743
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

416
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,495
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

417
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,874
He must be anxious enough as it is...

418
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,085
...knowing what lies ahead.

419
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,005
Then again, we all are.

420
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,688
How did you do it?

421
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,776
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

422
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,861
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

423
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,281
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

424
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,825
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

425
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,911
Okay?

426
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,580
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

427
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,292
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

428
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,964
I didn't put my name in that cup.

429
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,219
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

430
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,431
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

431
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,475
...and I don't know why.

432
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,851
It just did.

433
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,312
Okay?

434
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,864
Piss off.

435
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,340
What a charismatic quartet.

436
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,301
Hello.

437
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,721
I'm Rita Skeeter.

438
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,808
I write for the Daily Prophet.

439
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:41,105
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

440
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,482
You're the juicy news.

441
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,862
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

442
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,532
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

443
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,910
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

444
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,122
In short, what makes a champion tick?

445
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,918
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

446
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,588
So who's feeling up to sharing?

447
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,510
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

448
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,566
This is cozy.

449
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,860
It's a broom cupboard.

450
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,529
You should feel right at home, then.

451
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,490
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

452
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,242
No.

453
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,578
So tell me, Harry.

454
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,664
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

455
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,333
I'm 14. Sorry.

456
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,461
- About to compete
against three students...

457
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,923
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

458
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,675
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

459
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,178
...in your dizziest daydreams.

460
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,722
Concerned?

461
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,726
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

462
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,770
Just ignore the quill.

463
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,773
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

464
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,525
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

465
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,445
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

466
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,865
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

467
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,784
No, I didn't enter.

468
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,577
Of course you didn't.

469
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,456
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

470
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,252
Scratch that last.

471
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,755
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

472
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,298
...how do you think they'd feel?

473
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,217
Proud? Or concerned...

474
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,221
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

475
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,974
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

476
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:46,063
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

477
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,681
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.

478
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,143
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

479
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,520
...and she's too easily recognized.

480
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,565
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

481
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:33,902
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

482
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,863
And make sure you're alone.

483
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,531
Sirius.

484
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,199
P. S:

485
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,160
The bird bites.

486
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,921
Sirius?

487
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,732
Harry Potter, age 12...

488
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,860
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

489
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,613
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

490
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,365
...and choking back tears...

491
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,424
Sirius. How...?

492
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,094
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

493
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,222
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

494
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,848
No!

495
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,725
I had to ask.

496
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:51,688
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

497
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,274
But who was the third man in the room?

498
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,944
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

499
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,321
No.

500
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,951
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

501
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,411
And what was that?

502
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,248
He wanted...

503
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,083
...me.

504
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,963
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

505
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,341
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

506
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,427
Yes.

507
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,137
It's just a dream.

508
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,305
Look, Harry.

509
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,976
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

510
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:33,147
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

511
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,398
What are you saying?

512
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,819
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

513
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:43,365
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

514
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,368
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

515
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,912
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

516
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,878
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

517
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,338
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

518
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:02,509
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

519
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:06,096
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

520
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,102
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

521
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,357
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

522
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,943
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

523
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:24,239
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

524
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,118
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

525
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,687
Amazing.

526
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,360
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

527
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,320
Right, sorry.

528
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,199
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

529
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,536
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

530
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,747
It's already been through enough people.

531
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,041
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

532
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,836
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

533
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,047
What do you want me to say again?

534
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,590
Go.

535
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:30,639
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

536
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,893
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

537
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,479
Is that right? Well, you...

538
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,730
What?

539
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,780
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

540
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,494
Dean was told by Parvati that...

541
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,998
Please don't ask me to say it again.

542
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,791
Hagrid's looking for you.

543
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,378
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

544
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,224
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

545
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,977
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

546
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,520
You'll see soon enough.

547
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,939
Now pay attention, this is important.

548
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,067
What's with the flower?

549
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,529
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

550
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,698
As a matter of fact, I have.

551
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,076
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

552
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,045
Hagrid?

553
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,800
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

554
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,769
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

555
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,648
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

556
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,484
...you had forgotten me.

557
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,611
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

558
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,030
What is it you wanted to show me?

559
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,993
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

560
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,828
...exhilarated.

561
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,248
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

562
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,594
Can we get closer?

563
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,853
Dragons?

564
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,522
That's the first task?

565
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,899
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

566
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,278
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

567
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,864
Oh, crikey!

568
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,492
Although, I have to admit...

569
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,495
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

570
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,415
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

571
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,043
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

572
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,714
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

573
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,257
Didn't Ron tell you that?

574
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,677
No, he didn't.

575
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,263
He didn't tell me a thing.

576
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,317
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

577
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,488
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

578
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,324
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

579
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,077
Like the badge?

580
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,371
Excuse me.

581
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,002
Harry.

582
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,546
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

583
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,214
Can I have a word?

584
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,050
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

585
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,220
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

586
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,267
Dragons. That's the first task.

587
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,604
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

588
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,773
Are you serious?

589
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,610
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

590
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,029
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

591
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,655
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

592
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,325
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

593
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,536
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

594
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,122
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

595
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,291
It just happens a fair bit.

596
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,544
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

597
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,588
You're a right foul git, you know that?

598
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,965
- You think so?
- I know so.

599
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,467
Anything else?

600
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,137
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

601
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:45,143
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

602
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,313
My father and I have a bet, you see.

603
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,650
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

604
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,155
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

605
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,450
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

606
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,455
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

607
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,875
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

608
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,005
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

609
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:18,009
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

610
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,928
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

611
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,014
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

612
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:28,186
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

613
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,735
Stand still! Stand still!

614
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,915
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

615
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,042
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

616
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,044
Professor!

617
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,798
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

618
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,676
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

619
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,638
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

620
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,016
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

621
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:11,021
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

622
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,565
Away!

623
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,904
You. Come with me.

624
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,191
That's a Foe-Glass.

625
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,027
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

626
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,907
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

627
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,538
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

628
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,749
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

629
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,709
Now...

630
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,214
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

631
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,428
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

632
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,390
Sit.

633
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,478
Listen to me, Potter.

634
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,647
Your pal Diggory?

635
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:40,235
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

636
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,696
Miss Delacour?

637
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,824
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

638
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,911
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

639
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,247
...but Karkaroff's is not.

640
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,249
They'll have a strategy.

641
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,877
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

642
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,300
Come on, Potter.

643
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,553
What are your strengths?

644
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,514
I don't know.

645
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,475
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

646
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,688
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

647
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,483
You're allowed a wand.

648
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,366
Bets! Place your bets!

649
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,702
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

650
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,830
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

651
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,791
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

652
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,543
Yes, sir?

653
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,546
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

654
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,049
Your attention, please.

655
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,885
This is a great day for all of us.

656
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:54,559
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

657
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,395
Please keep your seats at all times.

658
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,315
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

659
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,902
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

660
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,779
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

661
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,032
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

662
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,746
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

663
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,748
Battle a dragon.

664
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,505
Young love.

665
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,507
How...

666
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,260
...stirring.

667
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,100
If everything goes unfortunately today...

668
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,061
...you two may even
make the front page.

669
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,438
You have no business here.

670
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,607
This tent is for champions...

671
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,692
...and friends.

672
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:51,658
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

673
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,622
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

674
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,960
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

675
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,380
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

676
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,674
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

677
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,635
Sorry, I'll just go.

678
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,345
Barty, the bag.

679
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,014
Champions, in a circle around me.

680
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,309
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

681
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:22,397
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

682
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,983
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

683
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,738
The Welsh Green.

684
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,661
Mr. Krum.

685
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,583
The Chinese Fireball.

686
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,467
The Swedish Short-Snout.

687
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,927
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

688
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,346
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

689
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,186
The Hungarian Horntail.

690
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,483
These represent four
very real dragons...

691
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,694
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

692
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,363
Your objective is simple:

693
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,032
Collect the egg.

694
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,202
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

695
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,872
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

696
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,373
Any questions?

697
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,044
Very well. Good luck, champions.

698
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,005
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

699
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,518
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

700
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,449
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

701
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,119
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

702
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,790
And now our fourth
and final contestant.

703
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,337
Harry! Harry! Harry!

704
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,365
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

705
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,909
Accio Firebolt!

706
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,066
- Yeah!
- Yes!

707
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,409
Oh, my God.

708
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,339
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

709
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,535
Yes! Yes!

710
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,435
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.

711
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,563
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

712
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,481
- Never!
- Never!

713
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,901
Shush!

714
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,071
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

715
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,908
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

716
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,245
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

717
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,842
What the bloody hell was that?

718
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,724
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

719
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,936
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

720
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:06,027
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

721
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,155
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

722
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,408
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

723
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,827
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.

724
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,291
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

725
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,587
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

726
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,255
No, no, no, I did.

727
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,467
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

728
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,679
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

729
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:37,808
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

730
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,812
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

731
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,023
...after you'd figured that out.

732
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,068
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

733
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,153
That's completely mental.

734
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,365
Yeah. Isn't it?

735
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,575
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

736
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,871
Boys.

737
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,772
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

738
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,028
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

739
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,659
Shush.

740
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,703
Look at this!

741
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,207
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

742
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,502
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

743
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,422
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

744
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,882
Her latest prey, sources report...

745
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:55,678
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

746
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,890
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

747
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,227
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

748
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,895
Thank you, Nigel.

749
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,528
Not now, Nigel. Later.

750
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,906
Go on.

751
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,998
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

752
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,960
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

753
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,928
Mum sent me a dress.

754
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:41,932
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

755
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,226
Nose down, Harry.

756
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,647
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

757
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,276
What are you on about?

758
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,403
They're not for Ginny.

759
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,905
They're for you.

760
01:07:56,947 --> 01:08:00,701
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

761
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,121
The Yule Ball...

762
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:09,627
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

763
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,421
...since its inception.

764
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:16,967
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

765
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,803
...gather in the Great Hall...

766
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:23,015
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

767
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,811
As representatives of the host school...

768
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:32,024
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

769
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,027
And I mean this literally, because...

770
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:39,657
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

771
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,992
...a dance.

772
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,040
Silence!

773
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,252
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

774
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:54,046
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

775
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:58,300
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

776
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,680
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

777
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,349
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

778
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,017
Now, to dance...

779
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,896
...is to let the body breathe.

780
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,400
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

781
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,944
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

782
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:21,115
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

783
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,410
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

784
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,829
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

785
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,415
Will you join me, please?

786
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:37,548
Now, place your right hand
on my waist.

787
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,301
- Where?
- My waist.

788
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:43,012
And extend your arm.

789
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,431
Mr. Filch, if you please.

790
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,519
One, two, three.

791
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,189
One, two, three. One, two, three.

792
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:00,029
Never gonna let him forget this,
are you?

793
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:01,363
- Never.
- Never.

794
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,409
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

795
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,434
Why do they have to travel in packs?

796
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,229
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

797
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:44,615
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.

Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1116
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:48,093
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1117
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,805
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1118
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:55,768
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1119
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:59,688
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1120
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,024
...about plants.

1121
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:04,068
Now, if there's...

1122
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:09,031
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1123
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:11,659
...then great. But otherwise...

1124
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:15,621
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1125
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:19,750
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1126
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,377
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1127
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:23,003
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1128
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,297
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1129
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:26,966
Don't be so mean.

1130
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,426
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1131
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,597
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1132
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,683
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1133
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:37,351
Most likely?

1134
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,770
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1135
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:42,398
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1136
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:45,234
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1137
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,361
I just wanted to help.

1138
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:50,614
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1139
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:52,533
Where are they anyway?

1140
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:55,744
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1141
01:38:02,793 --> 01:38:05,004
Welcome to the second task.

1142
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:08,882
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1143
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,426
A treasure of sorts.

1144
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:13,220
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1145
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:16,056
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1146
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,808
In order to win...

1147
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:21,854
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1148
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:24,648
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1149
01:38:24,815 --> 01:38:28,402
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1150
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:32,448
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1151
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,242
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1152
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:04,730
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1153
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:09,026
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1154
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:12,821
Yeah!

1155
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:15,616
What?

1156
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:37,322
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1157
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,992
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1158
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:43,787
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1159
01:42:01,573 --> 01:42:03,367
But she's my friend too!

1160
01:42:04,993 --> 01:42:06,703
Only one!

1161
01:42:58,088 --> 01:42:59,965
Let's get down below.

1162
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:12,853
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1163
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:12,037
Yes!

1164
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:32,224
Ascendio!

1165
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:39,189
Harry!

1166
01:44:41,483 --> 01:44:42,943
He's all right.

1167
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:45,612
He's all right. Barty!

1168
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:49,199
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1169
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:53,203
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1170
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:55,580
My little sister.

1171
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:57,582
Thank you.

1172
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:01,128
And you! You helped.

1173
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:04,798
Well, yeah, a bit.

1174
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:13,181
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1175
01:45:13,348 --> 01:45:16,018
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1176
01:45:17,269 --> 01:45:19,146
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

1177
01:45:19,354 --> 01:45:21,398
I finished last, Hermione.

1178
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:26,361
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1179
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,781
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1180
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:32,784
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1181
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,748
Attention!

1182
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:42,085
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1183
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:46,048
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1184
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:48,884
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1185
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:54,014
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1186
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:58,477
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1187
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:00,604
...second place...

1188
01:46:00,812 --> 01:46:02,272
- Second place!
- Well done!

1189
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:05,108
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1190
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:07,903
Yes!

1191
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:13,200
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1192
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,993
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1193
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,496
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1194
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:20,373
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1195
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,167
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1196
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:23,919
Well done, boy.

1197
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:27,339
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1198
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:31,468
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1199
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:35,931
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1200
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:38,100
...to lose one's family.

1201
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:42,270
Never whole again, are we?

1202
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:46,608
Still, life goes on...

1203
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:48,944
...and here we stand.

1204
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:54,574
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1205
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:56,201
Bartemius!

1206
01:46:56,409 --> 01:47:00,539
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1207
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:04,126
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1208
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:18,265
And they say I'm mad.

1209
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:31,111
[MOODY COUGHS]

1210
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:37,617
If you want to play the hero, I can
find you plenty of playmates among the first years.

1211
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:40,620
Otherwise, I suggest you grow up
and grow up fast.

1212
01:47:40,912 --> 01:47:43,081
There are worse than mermaids
ahead of you.

1213
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:45,458
We can win this.

1214
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:02,225
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1215
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:05,437
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1216
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:08,523
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.

1217
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:12,777
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1218
01:48:12,944 --> 01:48:16,281
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1219
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:17,991
And Harry, of course.

1220
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:23,538
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1221
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:25,790
Hooray!

1222
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:29,669
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

1223
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:32,464
<i>Teach us something, please</i>

1224
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:43,934
Mr. Crouch?

1225
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:53,193
RON:
He'll cover this up, you watch.

1226
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:56,321
Fudge will sell his soul
before this gets out in the Daily Prophet.

1227
01:48:56,696 --> 01:48:58,031
Why?

1228
01:48:58,031 --> 01:49:02,410
Look. Nobody liked Crouch.
I know this from my father.

1229
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:04,871
Loads of people wanted him dead.

1230
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:06,873
But he was a Ministry official.

1231
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:11,378
It's not even like he turned up stiff
in Knockturn Alley.

1232
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:14,381
He was murdered at Hogwarts.

1233
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:16,466
This is a big deal.

1234
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:18,426
It can't be coincidence.

1235
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,638
Harry's dreams, his scar hurting.

1236
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:23,473
The Dark Mark.

1237
01:49:23,473 --> 01:49:26,184
His name coming out of
the Goblet of Fire.

1238
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:31,189
Surviving the tournament
isn't the answer anymore, Harry.

1239
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:33,567
It's bigger than this.

1240
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:36,903
And I really think you
should go to Dumbledore.

1241
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:38,405
RON:
Yeah.

1242
01:49:49,499 --> 01:49:53,086
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1243
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,796
I will not.

1244
01:49:55,005 --> 01:49:59,050
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1245
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:00,635
Then for once show them some!

1246
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:04,848
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1247
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:08,184
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1248
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:11,146
- What did you say? What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1249
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:15,025
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1250
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:20,905
Oh, Harry!

1251
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:23,408
Harry, how good to see you again.

1252
01:50:24,242 --> 01:50:25,702
I can come back later, professor.

1253
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:29,247
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1254
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,958
Minister, after you.

1255
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:34,502
There you are. Your hat.

1256
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:38,381
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1257
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:41,718
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1258
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,621
AH!

1259
01:51:56,584 --> 01:51:59,838
AHHHHHHH!

1260
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,769
Professor?

1261
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:17,480
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1262
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:32,162
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1263
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:34,247
...to present evidence to this council.

1264
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:37,167
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1265
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:41,379
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1266
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:46,134
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1267
01:52:46,342 --> 01:52:47,969
Do you accept these terms?

1268
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:51,264
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1269
01:52:51,639 --> 01:52:54,100
I have names, sir.

1270
01:52:54,642 --> 01:52:58,229
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1271
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:03,401
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1272
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,737
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1273
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:08,531
- If that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1274
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:11,993
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1275
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,537
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1276
01:53:14,704 --> 01:53:15,872
Yeah, the same.

1277
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,709
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1278
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,255
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1279
01:53:24,422 --> 01:53:26,382
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1280
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:31,262
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1281
01:53:31,429 --> 01:53:34,432
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1282
01:53:34,599 --> 01:53:38,561
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1283
01:53:38,728 --> 01:53:41,731
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1284
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:45,318
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1285
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:47,737
Silence!

1286
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:51,866
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1287
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:54,118
...this session is now concluded.

1288
01:53:54,285 --> 01:53:56,329
Oh, no, no, no.

1289
01:53:57,288 --> 01:53:58,748
I've heard about one more.

1290
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:01,459
- What's that?
- The name.

1291
01:54:01,709 --> 01:54:03,127
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1292
01:54:03,294 --> 01:54:05,338
...this person took part
in the capture...

1293
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:07,632
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1294
01:54:07,882 --> 01:54:11,344
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1295
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,846
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1296
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:16,599
Barty Crouch...

1297
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:20,311
...Junior.

1298
01:54:29,779 --> 01:54:31,489
Hold him down!

1299
01:54:35,159 --> 01:54:38,746
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1300
01:54:40,456 --> 01:54:42,041
Hello, Father.

1301
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:45,503
You are no son of mine.

1302
01:54:56,848 --> 01:55:01,311
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1303
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:04,063
It's a Pensieve.

1304
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:08,860
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1305
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:12,572
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1306
01:55:13,072 --> 01:55:15,992
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1307
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,744
...some small detail...

1308
01:55:19,203 --> 01:55:21,331
...something I might have overlooked...

1309
01:55:21,497 --> 01:55:25,710
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1310
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:30,340
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1311
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:33,051
It's maddening.

1312
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:37,138
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1313
01:55:37,889 --> 01:55:39,932
What exactly happened to him?

1314
01:55:40,141 --> 01:55:44,938
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1315
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:49,192
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1316
01:55:50,693 --> 01:55:53,613
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1317
01:55:54,405 --> 01:55:56,532
I had a dream about him.

1318
01:55:58,785 --> 01:56:01,537
It was in the summer, before school.

1319
01:56:03,748 --> 01:56:06,751
In the dream, I was in a house.

1320
01:56:06,918 --> 01:56:11,714
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.

1321
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:15,468
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1322
01:56:15,885 --> 01:56:18,721
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1323
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:21,182
Always the same one.

1324
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:26,521
Sir, these dreams...

1325
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:31,943
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1326
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:36,531
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1327
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:38,992
I think it's best if you simply...

1328
01:56:44,622 --> 01:56:46,416
...cast them away.

1329
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:59,595
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1330
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:09,522
Potter!

1331
01:57:09,731 --> 01:57:12,233
What's your hurry?

1332
01:57:17,363 --> 01:57:21,117
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1333
01:57:21,325 --> 01:57:23,536
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1334
01:57:24,328 --> 01:57:25,872
Yes, sir.

1335
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:28,207
Ingenious.

1336
01:57:30,042 --> 01:57:33,963
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1337
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:38,342
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1338
01:57:40,011 --> 01:57:41,971
Nor is this.

1339
01:57:46,184 --> 01:57:47,810
Know what it is?

1340
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:50,521
Bubble juice, sir?

1341
01:57:51,147 --> 01:57:53,024
Veritaserum.

1342
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:57,445
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1343
01:57:57,653 --> 01:58:02,784
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1344
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:06,496
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1345
01:58:06,704 --> 01:58:11,501
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1346
01:58:11,709 --> 01:58:16,088
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1347
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:22,929
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1348
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:27,016
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1349
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:29,393
...I'm going to find out why!

1350
01:58:31,395 --> 01:58:33,439
What do you suppose
is on Karkaroff's arm?

1351
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:34,690
I don't know.

1352
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:36,818
Boomslang skin and lacewing flies.

1353
01:58:36,818 --> 01:58:39,612
You're sure those are the two
ingredients Snape mentioned?

1354
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:41,113
Positive, why?

1355
01:58:41,113 --> 01:58:44,575
Well, he thinks we're brewing
Polyjuice Potion, doesn't he?

1356
01:58:45,743 --> 01:58:49,247
I don't care what Snape thinks.
I've got bigger problems than detention.

1357
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:51,791
Something's coming closer.

1358
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,960
I can feel it.

1359
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,508
[CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING]
[VICTORIOUS BAND MUSIC PLAYING]

1360
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,284
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1361
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,304
Sonorus!

1362
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:55,897
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1363
01:59:56,063 --> 02:00:01,027
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1364
02:00:03,112 --> 02:00:04,906
...and Mr. Potter...

1365
02:00:06,782 --> 02:00:08,492
...are tied for first position...

1366
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:12,830
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1367
02:00:14,081 --> 02:00:17,501
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1368
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:21,464
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1369
02:00:25,843 --> 02:00:28,596
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1370
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:31,682
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1371
02:00:31,849 --> 02:00:36,312
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1372
02:00:36,687 --> 02:00:40,608
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1373
02:00:43,736 --> 02:00:48,032
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1374
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:51,577
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1375
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:54,789
You see, people change in the maze.

1376
02:00:54,956 --> 02:00:56,666
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1377
02:00:56,832 --> 02:01:01,629
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1378
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:06,092
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1379
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:16,602
Good luck.

1380
02:01:16,978 --> 02:01:18,938
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1381
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:23,859
On the count of three. One...

02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:56,030

No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1389
02:05:58,717 --> 02:06:00,761
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1390
02:06:12,439 --> 02:06:14,066
Yes.

Reducto!

1396
02:07:09,121 --> 02:07:11,582
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1397
02:07:11,999 --> 02:07:16,712
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1398
02:07:16,879 --> 02:07:18,589
For a moment, so did I.

1399
02:07:20,507 --> 02:07:21,675
Some game, huh?

1400
02:07:22,676 --> 02:07:24,053
Some game.

1401
02:07:29,516 --> 02:07:31,143
Go!

1402
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,323
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1403
02:07:44,531 --> 02:07:46,492
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

...three!
...three!

1405
02:08:00,422 --> 02:08:03,258
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1406
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:11,725
Where are we?

1407
02:08:17,398 --> 02:08:19,024
I've been here before.

1408
02:08:22,694 --> 02:08:24,238
It's a Portkey.

1409
02:08:26,115 --> 02:08:30,327
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1410
02:08:32,413 --> 02:08:35,749
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1411
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:37,918
What are you talking about?

1412
02:08:43,173 --> 02:08:46,093
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1413
02:08:53,725 --> 02:08:56,019
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1414
02:08:56,228 --> 02:08:58,981
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1415
02:09:10,284 --> 02:09:12,161
Do it! Now!

1416
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:26,592
Bone of the father...

1417
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:29,720
...unwillingly given.

1418
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,563
Flesh of the servant...

1419
02:09:41,648 --> 02:09:44,818
...willingly sacrificed.

1420
02:09:48,906 --> 02:09:52,659
And blood of the enemy...

1421
02:09:58,457 --> 02:10:00,918
...forcibly taken.

1422
02:10:07,007 --> 02:10:09,927
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1423
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:12,679
...again.

1424
02:11:16,076 --> 02:11:19,413
My wand, Wormtail.

1425
02:11:29,006 --> 02:11:30,966
Hold out your arm.

1426
02:11:31,133 --> 02:11:32,759
Master.

1427
02:11:32,926 --> 02:11:35,512
Thank you, master.

1428
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:37,180
The other arm, Wormtail.

1429
02:12:17,804 --> 02:12:19,681
Welcome, my friends.

1430
02:12:21,141 --> 02:12:23,894
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1431
02:12:24,519 --> 02:12:30,025
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1432
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:33,904
I confess myself...

1433
02:12:34,363 --> 02:12:35,906
...disappointed.

1434
02:12:36,615 --> 02:12:38,659
Not one of you tried to find me.

1435
02:12:38,867 --> 02:12:42,204
Crabbe! Macnair!

1436
02:12:43,163 --> 02:12:44,498
Goyle!

1437
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,627
Not even you...

1438
02:12:52,506 --> 02:12:54,383
...Lucius.

1439
02:12:56,259 --> 02:13:01,056
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1440
02:13:01,264 --> 02:13:04,267
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1441
02:13:04,434 --> 02:13:09,564
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1442
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:16,905
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1443
02:13:18,949 --> 02:13:21,535
...that is my true mask.

1444
02:13:21,952 --> 02:13:23,495
I returned.

1445
02:13:25,997 --> 02:13:29,835
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1446
02:13:31,044 --> 02:13:36,800
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1447
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:44,307
Thank you, master.

1448
02:13:44,933 --> 02:13:46,643
Thank you.

1449
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:52,149
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1450
02:13:53,608 --> 02:13:55,068
Harry.

1451
02:13:55,277 --> 02:13:58,029
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1452
02:13:58,238 --> 02:14:02,617
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1453
02:14:02,826 --> 02:14:04,202
I'd introduce you...

1454
02:14:04,369 --> 02:14:08,665
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1455
02:14:11,334 --> 02:14:14,004
The boy who lived.

1456
02:14:14,171 --> 02:14:17,090
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1457
02:14:17,257 --> 02:14:21,261
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1458
02:14:21,428 --> 02:14:26,141
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1459
02:14:26,308 --> 02:14:27,768
Yes, shall I?

1460
02:14:28,268 --> 02:14:29,603
It was love.

1461
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:34,232
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1462
02:14:34,441 --> 02:14:36,985
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1463
02:14:37,444 --> 02:14:39,237
I could not touch him.

1464
02:14:40,447 --> 02:14:42,574
It was old magic.

1465
02:14:42,783 --> 02:14:44,993
Something I should have foreseen.

1466
02:14:45,202 --> 02:14:46,995
But no matter, no matter.

1467
02:14:47,162 --> 02:14:49,372
Things have changed.

1468
02:14:50,123 --> 02:14:53,627
I can touch you...

1469
02:14:54,252 --> 02:14:55,962
...now.

1470
02:15:04,137 --> 02:15:05,472
Yeah.

1471
02:15:11,812 --> 02:15:15,482
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1472
02:15:16,691 --> 02:15:18,318
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1473
02:15:19,986 --> 02:15:22,197
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1474
02:15:23,824 --> 02:15:26,118
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1475
02:15:26,284 --> 02:15:28,662
First, we bow to each other.

1476
02:15:28,870 --> 02:15:31,248
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1477
02:15:31,456 --> 02:15:34,626
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1478
02:15:34,835 --> 02:15:36,169
I said, bow.

1479
02:15:38,004 --> 02:15:42,300
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1480
02:15:42,759 --> 02:15:44,636
Crucio!

1481
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:48,807
Crucio!

1482
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:51,852
Attaboy, Harry.

1483
02:15:52,018 --> 02:15:54,145
Your parents would be proud.

1484
02:15:54,437 --> 02:15:57,858
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1485
02:15:58,024 --> 02:15:59,568
Expelliar...

1486
02:16:02,612 --> 02:16:04,990
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1487
02:16:05,198 --> 02:16:07,158
I'm going to destroy you.

1488
02:16:09,369 --> 02:16:14,958
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1489
02:16:15,584 --> 02:16:18,128
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1490
02:16:18,336 --> 02:16:21,006
...they'll speak only of how you...

1491
02:16:21,298 --> 02:16:23,091
...begged for death.

1492
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:27,053
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1493
02:16:27,596 --> 02:16:29,222
...obliged.

1494
02:16:29,556 --> 02:16:31,016
Get up!

1495
02:16:36,062 --> 02:16:38,023
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1496
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:40,400
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1497
02:16:40,609 --> 02:16:43,778
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1498
02:16:57,709 --> 02:16:59,419
Have it your way.

1499
02:17:00,545 --> 02:17:02,881
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1500
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:23,109
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1501
02:17:27,697 --> 02:17:29,407
He's mine!

1502
02:18:02,482 --> 02:18:06,486
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1503
02:18:06,653 --> 02:18:08,655
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1504
02:18:08,863 --> 02:18:10,657
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1505
02:18:11,783 --> 02:18:14,786
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1506
02:18:15,036 --> 02:18:17,580
Take my body back to my father.

1507
02:18:18,623 --> 02:18:19,916
Let go.

1508
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:22,377
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1509
02:18:23,211 --> 02:18:25,797
Let go! Let go!

1510
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:32,929
Accio!

1511
02:18:38,643 --> 02:18:40,603
No!

1512
02:18:41,813 --> 02:18:43,815
[CHEERING AND MUSIC PLAY]

1513
02:18:53,366 --> 02:18:54,993
He did it!

1514
02:18:56,202 --> 02:18:57,829
Harry!

1515
02:19:00,665 --> 02:19:02,125
Harry!

1516
02:19:03,334 --> 02:19:06,588
No! No! No, don't!

1517
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,757
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1518
02:19:09,049 --> 02:19:11,593
He's back. He's back.

1519
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:13,845
Voldemort's back.

1520
02:19:14,012 --> 02:19:16,389
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1521
02:19:16,556 --> 02:19:18,850
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1522
02:19:19,059 --> 02:19:21,811
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1523
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,314
He's home. You both are.

1524
02:19:24,522 --> 02:19:28,109
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1525
02:19:31,196 --> 02:19:34,783
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1526
02:19:35,158 --> 02:19:36,868
Let me through.

1527
02:19:37,035 --> 02:19:38,495
Let me through!

1528
02:19:40,455 --> 02:19:41,706
Let me through!

1529
02:19:41,873 --> 02:19:43,249
That's my son!

1530
02:19:44,584 --> 02:19:46,044
That's my boy!

1531
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:51,549
It's my boy!

1532
02:19:54,386 --> 02:19:57,972
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1533
02:19:58,139 --> 02:20:01,059
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1534
02:20:01,768 --> 02:20:03,978
No!

1535
02:20:07,065 --> 02:20:09,442
It's all right, I got you.

1536
02:20:09,609 --> 02:20:12,946
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1537
02:20:16,950 --> 02:20:18,743
No!

1538
02:20:19,869 --> 02:20:21,746
No!

1539
02:21:04,122 --> 02:21:05,832
Are you all right, Potter?

1540
02:21:06,416 --> 02:21:08,293
Does it hurt? That?

1541
02:21:08,501 --> 02:21:10,295
Not so much now.

1542
02:21:11,254 --> 02:21:13,298
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1543
02:21:16,468 --> 02:21:18,428
The cup was a Portkey.

1544
02:21:21,181 --> 02:21:22,974
Someone had bewitched it.

1545
02:21:23,308 --> 02:21:25,351
What was it like?

1546
02:21:25,727 --> 02:21:27,353
- What was he like?
- Who?

1547
02:21:27,562 --> 02:21:29,272
The Dark Lord.

1548
02:21:31,649 --> 02:21:34,736
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1549
02:21:35,987 --> 02:21:37,780
I don't know.

1550
02:21:40,658 --> 02:21:43,578
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1551
02:21:46,539 --> 02:21:48,500
...into one of my nightmares.

1552
02:22:07,268 --> 02:22:08,811
Were there others?

1553
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:11,231
In the graveyard, were there others?

1554
02:22:15,193 --> 02:22:16,569
I...

1555
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:21,199
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1556
02:22:28,706 --> 02:22:31,960
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1557
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:39,384
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1558
02:22:39,592 --> 02:22:41,469
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1559
02:22:45,056 --> 02:22:48,726
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1560
02:22:48,893 --> 02:22:51,354
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1561
02:22:53,022 --> 02:22:55,692
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1562
02:22:55,858 --> 02:22:59,028
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1563
02:22:59,237 --> 02:23:00,780
...that led him straight to it?

1564
02:23:09,205 --> 02:23:13,167
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1565
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:17,422
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1566
02:23:17,588 --> 02:23:19,716
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1567
02:23:20,383 --> 02:23:23,886
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1568
02:23:24,053 --> 02:23:25,305
And now the deed is done.

1569
02:23:27,015 --> 02:23:31,311
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1570
02:23:39,861 --> 02:23:43,364
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1571
02:23:44,282 --> 02:23:46,743
...that I have once and for all...

1572
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:51,706
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1573
02:23:51,914 --> 02:23:53,124
Expelliarmus!

1574
02:23:57,879 --> 02:23:59,130
Severus.

1575
02:24:01,632 --> 02:24:03,092
That's it, take it.

1576
02:24:05,094 --> 02:24:08,514
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1577
02:24:08,723 --> 02:24:11,392
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1578
02:24:11,601 --> 02:24:14,687
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1579
02:24:17,732 --> 02:24:19,275
Harry, away from there!

1580
02:24:40,254 --> 02:24:43,591
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1581
02:24:44,550 --> 02:24:46,594
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1582
02:24:48,429 --> 02:24:49,514
Polyjuice Potion.

1583
02:24:49,681 --> 02:24:52,934
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1584
02:24:53,184 --> 02:24:55,061
We'll get you up in a minute.

1585
02:25:29,554 --> 02:25:30,930
Harry!

1586
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,811
Barty Crouch Junior.

1587
02:25:37,061 --> 02:25:39,981
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1588
02:25:42,358 --> 02:25:43,526
Your arm, Harry.

1589
02:25:47,905 --> 02:25:50,116
You know what this means, don't you?

1590
02:25:51,075 --> 02:25:52,410
He's back.

1591
02:25:53,578 --> 02:25:55,705
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1592
02:25:56,664 --> 02:25:58,958
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1593
02:25:59,208 --> 02:26:03,754
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1594
02:26:04,213 --> 02:26:06,674
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1595
02:26:07,258 --> 02:26:10,094
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1596
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:32,700
Today, we acknowledge...

1597
02:26:33,409 --> 02:26:36,162
...a really terrible loss.

1598
02:26:38,289 --> 02:26:41,042
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1599
02:26:41,209 --> 02:26:43,503
...exceptionally hard-working...

1600
02:26:44,504 --> 02:26:46,798
...infinitely fair-minded...

1601
02:26:47,381 --> 02:26:49,675
...and, most importantly...

1602
02:26:49,967 --> 02:26:54,514
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1603
02:26:55,681 --> 02:27:00,061
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1604
02:27:03,105 --> 02:27:04,649
You see...

1605
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:07,527
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1606
02:27:08,486 --> 02:27:10,446
...by Lord Voldemort!

1607
02:27:12,365 --> 02:27:15,952
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1608
02:27:16,577 --> 02:27:20,248
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1609
02:27:22,458 --> 02:27:24,085
Now, the pain...

1610
02:27:24,293 --> 02:27:27,964
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1611
02:27:28,130 --> 02:27:29,423
...and reminds us...

1612
02:27:29,632 --> 02:27:33,302
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1613
02:27:33,511 --> 02:27:36,931
...our hearts beat as one.

1614
02:27:37,431 --> 02:27:39,475
In light of recent events...

1615
02:27:39,809 --> 02:27:44,689
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1616
02:27:45,606 --> 02:27:50,945
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1617
02:27:51,362 --> 02:27:53,489
You remember that...

1618
02:27:54,115 --> 02:27:57,118
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1619
02:27:57,702 --> 02:28:00,162
...kind and honest...

1620
02:28:00,663 --> 02:28:05,209
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1621
02:28:30,484 --> 02:28:32,528
I never liked these curtains.

1622
02:28:33,112 --> 02:28:35,781
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1623
02:28:36,115 --> 02:28:37,908
By accident, of course.

1624
02:28:43,623 --> 02:28:48,002
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1625
02:28:51,422 --> 02:28:53,049
Professor...

1626
02:28:53,299 --> 02:28:56,302
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1627
02:28:57,094 --> 02:29:01,474
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1628
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:05,394
Priori Incantatem.

1629
02:29:09,565 --> 02:29:12,276
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1630
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:14,654
They reappeared.

1631
02:29:16,155 --> 02:29:19,909
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1632
02:29:22,495 --> 02:29:25,122
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1633
02:29:25,581 --> 02:29:30,378
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1634
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:35,424
But remember this:

1635
02:29:35,633 --> 02:29:37,510
You have friends here.

1636
02:29:39,553 --> 02:29:41,263
You're not alone.

1637
02:30:01,993 --> 02:30:03,703
Hermione.

1638
02:30:04,161 --> 02:30:06,122
This is for you.

1639
02:30:06,747 --> 02:30:08,958
Write to me. Promise.

1640
02:30:10,042 --> 02:30:11,419
Bye.

1641
02:30:17,675 --> 02:30:19,635
Au revoir, Ron.

1642
02:31:03,554 --> 02:31:06,098
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1643
02:31:06,265 --> 02:31:07,349
- No.
- No.

1644
02:31:07,558 --> 02:31:11,937
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1645
02:31:16,358 --> 02:31:19,195
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1646
02:31:26,494 --> 02:31:27,953
Yes.

1647
02:31:32,708 --> 02:31:35,961
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1648
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:38,714
I won't. You know I won't.

1649
02:31:40,007 --> 02:31:43,761
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
