1
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,105
I killed Sirius Black!

2
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,528
He's back.

3
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,258
The police are
continuing with the investigation...

4
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,469
...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,348
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

6
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,183
The surrounding area remains closed.

7
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,519
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

8
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,109
"Harry Potter. "

9
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,278
Who's Harry Potter?

10
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,823
Oh, no one.

11
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,742
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,913
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,707
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,669
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,972
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,933
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,069
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,530
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,700
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,120
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

21
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,623
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

22
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,334
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,086
Take my arm.

24
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,008
Do as I say.

25
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,602
I just Apparated, didn't I?

26
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,938
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

27
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,733
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,651
I can't imagine why.

29
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,121
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:16,584
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

31
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,461
Am I right?

32
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,006
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

33
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,387
Wands out, Harry.

34
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,275
Horace?

35
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,831
Horace?

36
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,384
Merlin's beard!

37
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,846
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

38
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,725
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

39
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,063
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

40
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,900
Dragon's blood.

41
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,445
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

42
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,616
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

43
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,242
...Horace Slughorn.

44
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,911
Horace...

45
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,872
...well, you know who this is.

46
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,750
Harry Potter.

47
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,338
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

48
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,965
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

49
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,593
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

50
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,514
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

51
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,015
Do you know what that's like?

52
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,936
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

53
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,438
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

54
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,485
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

55
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,980
That was fun.

56
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,984
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

57
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,988
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

58
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:37,660
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

59
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,129
You're very like your father.

60
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,133
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

61
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,012
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

62
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,515
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

63
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,268
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

64
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,478
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

65
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,858
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

66
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,818
Right at the front.

67
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,288
All mine. Each and every one.

68
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,540
Ex-students, I mean.

69
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,172
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

70
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,550
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

71
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,010
...on the news of the day.

72
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,847
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

73
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,475
Free tickets whenever I want them.

74
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,644
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

75
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,898
Ah, yes.

76
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,233
Regulus Black.

77
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,363
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

78
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,074
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

79
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,451
It's a shame. Talented boy.

80
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,915
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

81
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,000
Horace?

82
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,252
Do you mind if I take this?

83
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,469
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

84
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,764
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

85
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,225
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

86
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,353
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

87
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,523
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

88
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,858
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

89
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,194
Bye.

90
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,707
All right. I'll do it.

91
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,462
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

92
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,842
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

93
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,262
They are indeed.

94
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,559
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

95
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,814
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

96
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,401
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

97
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,945
You would be his crowning jewel.

98
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:23,659
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

99
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,496
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

100
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:32,710
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

101
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,338
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

102
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,176
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

103
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,345
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

104
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,182
Both are waiting for you.

105
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,217
Hedwig.

106
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,054
Mum?

107
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,807
Ginny, what is it?

108
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,476
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

109
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,896
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

110
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,233
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

111
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,903
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

112
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,199
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

113
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,326
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

114
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,538
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

115
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,207
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

116
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,125
He's wandering about the house.

117
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,044
- Really?
- Really.

118
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,879
Harry!

119
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,804
Harry!

120
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,017
What a lovely surprise.

121
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,438
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

122
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,441
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

123
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,860
But then, what would we do
without him?

124
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,781
Got a bit of toothpaste.

125
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,415
So when did you get here?

126
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,292
A few days ago.

127
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,545
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

128
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,632
Mum sort of lost it last week.

129
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,760
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

130
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,304
That it's too dangerous.

131
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,307
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

132
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,810
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

133
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,856
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

134
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,567
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

135
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,822
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

136
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,701
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

137
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,162
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

138
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,122
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

139
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,874
What is he?

140
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,252
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

141
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,151
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

142
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,778
The Dark Lord trusts him.

143
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,531
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

144
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,063
Run along, Wormtail.

145
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,568
I know I ought not to be here.

146
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,447
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

147
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,283
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

148
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,705
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

149
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,546
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

150
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,880
You?

151
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,259
The Dark Lord told you?

152
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,387
Your sister doubts me.

153
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,266
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

154
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,186
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

155
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:06,525
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

156
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,610
I don't doubt you, Severus.

157
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,947
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

158
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,245
He's just a boy.

159
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,124
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

160
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,421
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

161
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,092
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

162
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,599
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

163
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,522
It's just empty words.

164
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,901
He'll give it his best effort.

165
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,445
But when it matters most...

166
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:57,284
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

167
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,372
Coward.

168
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,004
Take out your wand.

169
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,352
Will you...

170
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,562
...Severus Snape...

171
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,649
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

172
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:33,654
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

173
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,698
I will.

174
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,745
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

175
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,623
...protect him from harm?

176
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,376
I will.

177
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,964
And if Draco should fail...

178
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,719
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

179
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:02,891
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

180
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,648
I will.

181
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,424
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

182
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,633
Nosebleed Nougats!

183
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,887
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

184
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,932
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

185
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,782
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

186
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,076
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

187
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,995
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

188
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,457
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

189
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,960
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

190
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,295
Meaning?

191
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

192
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,799
It's none of your business.

193
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,598
How much for this?

194
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,141
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

195
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,435
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

196
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,811
I'm your brother.

197
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,230
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

198
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,817
Come on, let's go.

199
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,696
Hi, Ron.

200
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,007
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

201
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,760
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

202
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,179
I reckon he's right.

203
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,557
Oh, no.

204
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,352
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

205
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,199
Harry?

206
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,120
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

207
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,997
...who don't want to be followed?

208
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,561
Quibbler.

209
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,898
Quibbler.

210
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:26,488
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

211
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,032
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

212
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,786
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

213
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,123
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

214
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,208
Quibbler.

215
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,430
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

216
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,306
And who were all those people?

217
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,601
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

218
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,687
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

219
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,356
It's happened. He's one of them.

220
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,024
One of what?

221
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,237
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

222
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,364
You're barking.

223
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,658
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

224
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,871
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

225
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,914
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

226
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,960
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

227
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,712
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

228
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,215
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

229
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,469
I need some air.

230
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,989
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

231
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,638
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

232
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,933
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

233
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,478
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

234
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,950
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

235
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,118
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

236
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,412
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

237
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,914
What's that supposed to mean?

238
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:46,002
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

239
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,631
Amused, Blaise?

240
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,510
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

241
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,411
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

242
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,872
Where's Harry?

243
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,001
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

244
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,186
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

245
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,938
Petrificus Totalus.

246
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,330
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

247
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,005
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

248
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,592
Finite.

249
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,016
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

250
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:10,105
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

251
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,489
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

252
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,826
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

253
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,036
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

254
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,247
That's nice.

255
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,625
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

256
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,628
Right. Names?

257
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,256
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

258
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,550
No exceptions, Potter.

259
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,844
Who are those people?

260
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,304
Aurors. For security.

261
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,931
What's this cane here, then?

262
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,475
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

263
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,646
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

264
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,900
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

265
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,322
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

266
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,665
Nice face, Potter.

267
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,549
Would you like me to fix it for you?

268
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,511
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

269
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,221
...but it's up to you.

270
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,932
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

271
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,811
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

272
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,775
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

273
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,237
- Episkey.
- Ah!

274
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,538
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

275
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,041
Brilliant.

276
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,467
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

277
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,057
Will you stop eating?

278
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,476
Your best friend is missing!

279
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,896
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

280
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,192
He's covered in blood again.

281
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:23,613
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

282
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,949
Where have you been?

283
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,576
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

284
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,370
What've I missed?

285
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,707
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

286
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,419
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

287
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,971
Very best of evenings to you all.

288
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,180
Thanks.

289
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:56,062
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

290
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,481
...Horace Slughorn.

291
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,237
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

292
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,700
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

293
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,786
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

294
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,746
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

295
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,623
Snape?

296
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,298
Now, as you know...

297
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,135
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

298
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,304
And you have the right to know why.

299
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,683
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

300
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,311
...sat in this very hall...

301
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:41,316
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

302
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,279
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

303
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,989
His name?

304
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,783
Tom Riddle.

305
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,624
Today, of course...

306
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,502
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

307
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,884
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

308
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,428
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

309
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,724
Every day, every hour...

310
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,851
...this very minute, perhaps...

311
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:21,356
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

312
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:28,529
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

313
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,701
Just something to think about.

314
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,537
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

315
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,999
That was cheerful.

316
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:50,051
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

317
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:55,848
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

318
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,061
Potter.

319
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,356
Oh, this can't be good.

320
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,027
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

321
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,156
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

322
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,076
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

323
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,912
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

324
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,333
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

325
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,378
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

326
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:30,133
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. S students...

327
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,093
...with "Exceeds Expectations. "

328
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,262
Brilliant. Um...

329
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,889
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

330
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,978
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

331
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,064
I don't wanna take Potions.

332
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,942
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

333
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,154
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

334
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,614
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

335
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,580
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

336
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,415
Ron Weasley, sir.

337
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,418
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

338
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,670
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

339
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,923
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

340
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,634
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

341
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,511
Get what you want from the cupboard.

342
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,015
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

343
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,144
Any ideas what these might be?

344
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,231
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

345
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,947
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

346
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,825
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

347
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,122
It's terribly tricky to make.

348
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,333
And this is Amortentia...

349
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,919
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

350
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,673
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

351
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,968
For example, I smell...

352
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,765
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

353
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,268
...spearmint toothpaste.

354
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,148
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

355
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:14,320
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

356
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:21,160
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

357
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,502
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

358
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,587
Oh, yes.

359
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,340
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

360
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:39,929
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

361
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,598
But it is more commonly referred to as...

362
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:48,062
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

363
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,566
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

364
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:57,363
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

365
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,909
At least until the effects wear off.

366
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,581
So this is what I offer each of you today.

367
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:11,586
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

368
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:16,340
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

369
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,760
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

370
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,598
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

371
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,101
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

372
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,937
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

373
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,607
Let the brewing commence.

374
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,405
This book is the property of the half blood prince

375
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,930
cut the sopophorus bean

376
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,269
How did you do that?

377
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,980
You crush it. Don't cut it.

378
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,650
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

379
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,652
No, really.

380
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,317
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

381
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,030
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

382
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,286
So here we are, then, as promised.

383
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,664
One vial of Felix Felicis.

384
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,874
Congratulations.

385
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,128
Use it well.

386
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,408
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

387
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,453
How are you?

388
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,163
I'm fine, sir.

389
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,581
Enjoying your classes?

390
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,877
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

391
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,880
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

392
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,715
Do you?

393
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,508
Definitely.

394
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,347
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

395
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,558
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

396
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,353
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

397
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,771
I can't help wondering...

398
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:21,942
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

399
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,112
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

400
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,074
But enough chitchat.

401
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,869
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

402
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,289
The answer lies here.

403
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,459
What you are looking at are memories.

404
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,463
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

405
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,091
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

406
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,972
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

407
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,350
...of the day I first met him.

408
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,479
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

409
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,354
I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

410
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,150
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

411
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,070
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

412
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,658
Tom, you have a visitor.

413
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,869
How do you do, Tom?

414
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,627
Don't.

415
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,555
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

416
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,765
I am a professor.

417
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,310
I don't believe you.

418
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,478
She wants me looked at.

419
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,273
They think I'm different.

420
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,941
Well, perhaps they're right.

421
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,568
I'm not mad.

422
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,071
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

423
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,240
Hogwarts is a school.

424
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,159
A school of magic.

425
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,416
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

426
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,212
Things other children can't.

427
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,549
I can make things move
without touching them.

428
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,054
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

429
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,391
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

430
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,977
I can make them hurt...

431
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,146
...if I want.

432
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,565
Who are you?

433
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,943
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

434
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,570
I'm different.

435
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,031
Prove it.

436
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,459
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

437
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,973
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

438
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:44,812
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

439
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,146
You understand me?

440
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,653
I can speak to snakes too.

441
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,698
They find me.

442
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,617
Whisper things.

443
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,996
Is that normal for someone like me?

444
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,353
Did you know, sir? Then?

445
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,151
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

446
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,862
If I had, I...

447
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,949
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

448
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,453
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

449
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,455
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

450
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,836
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

451
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,047
No, I did not.

452
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:57,051
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

453
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,928
And he will not give it up easily.

454
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,307
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

455
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,725
I did.

456
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,436
Do you want me to let him?

457
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,189
Yes.

458
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,066
All right. Um...

459
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,319
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

460
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,613
...just to assess your strengths.

461
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,324
Quiet! Please!

462
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,659
Shut it!

463
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,249
Thanks. All right. Um...

464
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,543
Just because you
made the team last year...

465
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,671
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

466
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,467
Good.

467
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,394
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

468
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,146
Hard feelings?

469
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,858
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

470
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,694
Really? Strapping guy like you?

471
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,447
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

472
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,033
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

473
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,203
Oh, I like my chances.

474
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:33,165
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

475
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:37,503
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

476
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,517
Come on, Weasley!

477
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,393
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

478
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,815
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

479
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,233
Go on, Cormac!

480
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,835
Come on, Ron!

481
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,389
Come on, Ron.

482
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,449
Confundus.

483
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,885
Isn't he brilliant?

484
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:14,141
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

485
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,269
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

486
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,731
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

487
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,817
He's vile.

488
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,033
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

489
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,285
No, I haven't.

490
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,580
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

491
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,207
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

492
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:43,545
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

493
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,964
What?

494
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,509
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

495
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,178
No.

496
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,972
Why not?

497
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,141
The binding is fragile.

498
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,936
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

499
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,775
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

500
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,695
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince. "

501
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,383
For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...

502
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,843
...yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?

503
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,430
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

504
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,640
Well, it's true.

505
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,560
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

506
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,729
It's just like being with Hermione.

507
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,525
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

508
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,236
- The library.
- The library. And?

509
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,780
And nothing.

510
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,992
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

511
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,244
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

512
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,746
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

513
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:04,584
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

514
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,507
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

515
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,093
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

516
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,888
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

517
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,516
No, not there. Over here.

518
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,685
No, sit beside me.

519
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,730
Okay.

520
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,566
Something to drink?

521
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,277
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

522
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,999
Oh, bloody hell.

523
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,795
Slick git.

524
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,798
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

525
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,886
And snogging.

526
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,514
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

527
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,266
You can't be serious.

528
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,810
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

529
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,898
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

530
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,651
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

531
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,820
And you, and you.

532
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,781
So, what brings you here?

533
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:20,660
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

534
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,289
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

535
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,793
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

536
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,379
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

537
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,757
...for the select student or two.

538
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,803
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

539
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,431
You would be welcome too, Granger.

540
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:46,978
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

541
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,815
Good to see you, Wallenby.

542
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,446
What are you playing at?

543
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,575
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

544
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,702
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

545
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,623
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

546
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,339
Got a little bit...

547
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,102
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

548
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,728
- Harry.
- What?

549
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,399
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

550
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,943
As if.

551
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,703
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

552
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,935
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

553
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:26,286
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

554
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,344
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

555
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,013
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

556
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,182
It's like I said.

557
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:52,312
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

558
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,274
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

559
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,612
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

560
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,615
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

561
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:13,833
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

562
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:19,339
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

563
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,466
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

564
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,057
What do you think?

565
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:35,772
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

566
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,191
She was cursed, wasn't she?

567
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,027
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

568
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,115
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

569
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,200
Yes, she was cursed.

570
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,661
It was Malfoy.

571
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:55,375
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

572
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,043
Indeed.

573
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,297
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

574
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,050
You just...

575
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,678
...know.

576
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,641
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

577
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,770
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

578
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:22,068
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

579
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,243
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

580
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,673
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

581
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,385
Well, what does she see in him?

582
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,763
Dean? He's brilliant.

583
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,766
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

584
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,728
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

585
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,441
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

586
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,610
I suppose.

587
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,031
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

588
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,201
She's smart, funny.

589
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,245
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

590
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,292
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

591
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,961
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

592
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:26,633
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

593
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,763
Hermione's got nice skin.

594
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,225
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

595
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,269
I've never really thought about it.

596
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,523
But, I suppose, yeah.

597
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,733
Very nice.

598
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,533
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

599
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:05,338
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

600
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,007
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

601
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,385
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

602
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,513
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

603
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,682
What about your uncle, Belby?

604
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,310
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

605
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:22,272
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

606
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:26,526
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

607
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,988
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

608
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:35,285
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

609
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,871
My parents are dentists.

610
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,710
They tend to people's teeth.

611
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:48,631
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

612
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,091
No.

613
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:56,556
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

614
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,974
He needed 10 stitches.

615
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,859
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

616
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,991
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

617
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,869
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

618
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:26,085
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

619
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,094
What?

620
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,888
Nothing.

621
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,856
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

622
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,488
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

623
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,241
I was just admiring your hourglass.

624
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,077
Oh, yes.

625
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,663
A most intriguing object.

626
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,584
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

627
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,129
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

628
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,548
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

629
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,052
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

630
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,471
As to some of your classmates...

631
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:22,058
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

632
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,726
The shelf, sir?

633
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,939
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

634
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,985
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

635
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,488
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

636
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,577
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

637
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,165
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

638
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,917
What was he like?

639
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,007
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

640
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,509
He killed my parents.

641
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,555
Of course.

642
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,933
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

643
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,855
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

644
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,025
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

645
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:16,446
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

646
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:18,364
Not unlike others I've known.

647
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,034
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

648
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,454
If the monster existed...

649
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,248
...it was buried deep within.

650
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,059
Good luck, eh, Ron.

651
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,937
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

652
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:53,191
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

653
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,693
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

654
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,405
What's he wearing?

655
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,874
So how was it, then?

656
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,419
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

657
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,213
Pretty boring, actually.

658
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,341
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

659
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,514
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

660
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,224
And we're meant to bring someone.

661
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:30,103
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

662
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,106
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

663
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,944
Good luck today, Ron.

664
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,114
I know you'll be brilliant.

665
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,912
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

666
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,580
Have it your way.

667
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,250
- Juice?
- Sure.

668
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,127
Hello, everyone.

669
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,463
You look dreadful, Ron.

670
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,007
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

671
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,845
Is it a tonic?

672
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,933
Liquid luck.

673
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,978
Don't drink it, Ron.

674
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,947
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

675
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,785
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

676
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,773
Go on, Ron! Do it!

677
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,017
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

678
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,481
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

679
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:53,829
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

680
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,794
You really shouldn't have done it.

681
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:04,966
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

682
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:10,596
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

683
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,101
You didn't put it in.

684
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,646
Ron only thought you did.

685
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,739
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

686
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,494
Well, they're really good.

687
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,002
How does it feel, Harry?

688
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,050
When you see Dean with Ginny?

689
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,598
I know.

690
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,851
I see the way you look at her.

691
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,187
You're my best friend.

692
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,114
Oops.

693
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,785
I think this room's taken.

694
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,954
What's with the birds?

695
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,043
Oppugno.

696
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,781
It feels like this.

697
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:16,532
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

698
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:21,787
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

699
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,372
It's chemical.

700
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:27,877
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

701
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:30,880
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

702
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,466
I really couldn't care less.

703
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:37,470
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

704
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,138
Yes.

705
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:43,726
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

706
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,102
Have you?

707
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:47,271
Yes. Why?

708
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:51,067
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

709
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,486
...we should go together, as friends.

710
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,279
Why didn't I think of that?

711
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,989
Who are you going with?

712
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,949
Um, it's a surprise.

713
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:03,329
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

714
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,831
See that girl over there?

715
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:12,171
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

716
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,839
Really?

717
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:18,260
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

718
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,137
But I am the Chosen One.

719
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:23,182
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

720
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,644
I'll ask someone I like.

721
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,979
Someone cool.

722
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,784
I've never been to this part of the castle.

723
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,204
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

724
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,873
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

725
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:22,074
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

726
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,339
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

727
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,552
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

728
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,610
Drink?

729
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,862
Neville.

730
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,488
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

731
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,783
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

732
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,745
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

733
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,133
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

734
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,597
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

735
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,808
Cormac? That's who you invited?

736
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,478
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

737
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,314
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

738
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,484
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

739
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,819
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

740
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,656
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

741
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,658
On second thoughts...

742
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:47,826
Might keep Cormac at bay.

743
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,080
Oh, God, here he comes.

744
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,502
I think she just went to powder her nose.

745
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,754
Slippery little minx, your friend.

746
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,632
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

747
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,679
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

748
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,473
Dragon balls.

749
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,821
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

750
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:27,866
Not so quick, Potter.

751
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,538
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

752
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:36,625
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

753
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,044
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

754
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,922
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

755
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,759
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

756
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,469
You see...

757
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:53,183
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

758
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,893
Traveling where?

759
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,903
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

760
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,740
Professor Slughorn, sir.

761
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:12,244
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

762
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,455
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

763
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,916
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

764
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,920
I'll escort him out.

765
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,385
Certainly, professor.

766
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,267
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

767
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:42,274
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

768
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,526
I swore to protect you.

769
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,030
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

770
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,365
I don't need protection.

771
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,703
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

772
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,166
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

773
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,670
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

774
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,297
No!

775
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:09,051
I was chosen. This is my moment.

776
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,065
"Unbreakable Vow. "

777
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,858
You're sure that's what Snape said?

778
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,319
Positive. Why?

779
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,989
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

780
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:34,493
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

781
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,745
You don't understand.

782
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,413
Oh, bloody hell.

783
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,193
I miss you.

784
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,447
Lovely.

785
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,908
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

786
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,286
I'll take your word for it.

787
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:32,342
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

788
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,595
You die.

789
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,059
Wait, the pudding's still here.

790
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,647
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

791
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,899
I know it sounds mad.

792
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:50,569
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

793
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,238
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

794
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:56,408
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

795
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,577
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

796
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:02,247
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

797
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:06,502
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

798
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:07,836
You're blinded by hatred.

799
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,047
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

800
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:14,801
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

801
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,929
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

802
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,057
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

803
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:46,083
Open up, you.

804
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,378
Don't you trust me?

805
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,718
It's good.

806
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,472
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

807
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,023
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

808
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,495
You'll have to forgive Remus.

809
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:26,582
It takes its toll, his condition.

810
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,543
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

811
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,254
We're being followed, all of us.

812
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,923
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

813
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,843
It's not been easy.

814
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,263
Did you get my owl?

815
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,515
Yes, I did.

816
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:48,061
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

817
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:50,689
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

818
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,900
As for Draco Malfoy...

819
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,694
...I know a bit more.

820
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,364
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

821
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,867
I think, from what you described...

822
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,702
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

823
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:07,372
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

824
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,041
...is a vanishing cabinet.

825
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,209
A vanishing cabinet?

826
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:15,380
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

827
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,508
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

828
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:23,430
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

829
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,807
They can transport you anywhere.

830
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,353
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

831
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:32,439
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

832
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,732
Nothing.

833
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,276
It's still there.

834
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,081
It was delicious, Molly, really.

835
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:50,582
Are you sure you won't stay?

836
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:55,128
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

837
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:56,338
Remus?

838
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,807
Sweetheart.

839
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,858
Has Ron gone to bed?

840
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,861
Um... Not yet. No.

841
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,989
Shoelace.

842
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,462
Merry Christmas, Harry.

843
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,424
Merry Christmas.

844
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,985
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

845
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,246
Ginny!

846
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:19,087
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

847
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,506
You coming to get me?

848
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,927
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

849
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,042
Harry?

850
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,228
Stupefy!

851
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,836
Harry!

852
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,559
Ginny!

853
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,631
Molly.

854
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,323
It's easy for them to get to you.

855
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:55,619
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

856
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:58,330
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

857
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,498
Sorry.

858
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,835
Tell me what Arthur said.

859
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,921
If Dumbledore is traveling,
it is news to the Ministry.

860
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:08,381
But what about this...

861
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:11,593
...that night at Borgin and Burkes,
Draco was looking at a vanishing cabinet.

862
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,595
What would Draco want with a vanishing cabinet?

863
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,472
You tell me.

864
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:19,267
He looks different, don't you think?
Draco. Almost ill.

865
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,644
Who can tell the difference?

866
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:23,980
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.
[Lavender giggles]

867
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,316
That's my Won-Won.

868
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,737
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

869
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,674
I'd like to know
where you get your information.

870
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,885
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.

871
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,059
Sir...

872
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:04,354
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

873
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,315
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

874
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:11,736
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

875
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,614
But how did you know?

876
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,034
Intuition.

877
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,915
Gracious. Is it that time already?

878
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,752
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

879
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:35,719
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

880
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,723
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

881
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:43,893
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

882
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:49,816
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

883
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:53,236
They might misunderstand.

884
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,988
Go on.

885
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,074
I was in the library the other night...

886
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,827
...in the Restricted Section...

887
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:05,123
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

888
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,544
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

889
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,505
It's called, as I understand it...

890
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,593
I beg your pardon?

891
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,346
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

892
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:25,310
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

893
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:29,439
Confused?

894
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:31,608
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

895
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:35,278
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

896
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:39,115
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

897
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,201
It is also a lie.

898
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:43,912
This memory has been tampered with...

899
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:48,458
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

900
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,086
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

901
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:54,130
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

902
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:55,799
Why, indeed?

903
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,969
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

904
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:03,765
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

905
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,475
...any way you can.

906
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,602
I don't know him that well, sir.

907
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,984
This memory is everything.

908
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,487
Without it, we are blind.

909
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:21,616
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

910
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,495
You have no choice.

911
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,706
You must not fail.

912
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,134
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

913
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,760
...with the chapter on antidotes.

914
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:44,681
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

915
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:47,350
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

916
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:56,609
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

917
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:58,695
To what do I owe this pleasure?

918
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,948
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

919
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,367
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

920
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:07,537
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

921
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,374
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

922
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:15,378
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

923
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:18,882
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

924
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:23,386
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

925
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:26,723
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

926
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,726
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

927
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,811
Yes. Um...

928
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:34,480
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

929
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:36,441
What I mean to say is...

930
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,068
...well, he's not like you.

931
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,571
He might misunderstand.

932
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:46,701
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

933
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,914
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

934
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,207
I suggest you do the same.

935
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:56,586
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

936
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,596
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

937
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,225
Didn't he?

938
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,900
Yes?

939
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,402
Oh, it's you, Potter.

940
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,947
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

941
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,915
Did you honestly expect you could just walk up to
old Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?

942
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:41,881
Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the
Daily Prophet should call you "The Dim One."

943
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:43,424
Nice.

944
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:49,681
Well, you're going to have to pursuade him somehow.
Now you've made it even harder.

945
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,434
I'm going to bed.

946
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:02,860
Hermione, I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.

947
01:28:03,152 --> 01:28:06,739
I've seen it sometimes.
Sometimes he just disappears off the map.

948
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:12,745
That's not possible. No one can
leave the castle these days. The map's wrong.

949
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,999
The map's never wrong.

950
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:21,546
Good night, Harry.

951
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:37,562
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

952
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,981
Divine.

953
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,942
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

954
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:47,655
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

955
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:51,326
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

956
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:53,494
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

957
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,997
She could never annoy me.

958
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,333
I think I love her.

959
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,214
Well, brilliant.

960
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,678
Do you think she knows I exist?

961
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,347
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

962
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,476
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

963
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:18,644
Who are you talking about?

964
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:23,024
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

965
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,692
Okay, very funny.

966
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,491
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

967
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:34,535
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

968
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,456
No. Can you introduce me?

969
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:04,899
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

970
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:19,372
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

971
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:21,624
Where's Romilda?

972
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,751
What's the matter with Wenby?

973
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,087
Very powerful love potion.

974
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,631
Very well. Better bring him in.

975
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:32,093
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

976
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,179
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

977
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:38,432
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

978
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,268
Perhaps you're right.

979
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:50,194
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

980
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:54,740
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

981
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:57,827
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

982
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,580
All the questions about Voldemort.

983
01:31:00,746 --> 01:31:02,582
Don't use that name.

984
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,383
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

985
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,678
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

986
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:32,487
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

987
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,780
A bloody strong one at that.

988
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:38,993
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

989
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,830
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

990
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:47,335
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

991
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,339
Here we are, Potter.

992
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,007
To life!

993
01:31:57,803 --> 01:31:58,846
Ron.

994
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,769
Ron. Professor, do something.

995
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:07,480
I don't understand.

996
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,665
Come on, Ron, breathe.

997
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:50,731
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

998
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:05,121
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

999
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:07,665
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

1000
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,252
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

1001
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,171
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

1002
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:18,342
The question is,
why were they necessary?

1003
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,261
Why, indeed?

1004
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,430
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

1005
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:25,600
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

1006
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:29,729
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

1007
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:32,356
...when not polluted with poison.

1008
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,651
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

1009
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:37,194
To whom, I might ask?

1010
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,198
To you, Headmaster.

1011
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:44,618
Where is he?

1012
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:48,914
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

1013
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,627
What's she doing here?

1014
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,047
I might ask you the same question.

1015
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:58,466
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1016
01:33:58,632 --> 01:34:01,385
I happen to be his friend.

1017
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:05,765
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1018
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:09,435
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1019
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:13,314
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1020
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,317
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1021
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:23,032
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1022
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:26,494
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1023
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,996
I'm here.

1024
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:38,047
Uh... Hermione...

1025
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,095
Hermione.

1026
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:47,098
Hermione.

1027
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:58,609
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1028
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,278
Well, come away, everybody.

1029
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,073
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1030
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:10,871
About time, don't you think?

1031
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,126
Thank you.

1032
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,880
Oh, shut up.

1033
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:35,975
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1034
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:43,107
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1035
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,777
Um, well...

1036
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:49,947
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1037
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:53,242
And you talked.

1038
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:58,914
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1039
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:02,376
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1040
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,878
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1041
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:14,889
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1042
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:21,562
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1043
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,732
Anything at all?

1044
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,734
There is something.

1045
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:34,700
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1046
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:39,413
Right. Boggled.

1047
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:47,921
Harry.

1048
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:50,549
That's Katie.

1049
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:54,136
Katie Bell.

1050
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:04,188
Katie. How are you?

1051
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:09,360
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1052
01:39:10,986 --> 01:39:14,531
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1053
01:39:14,948 --> 01:39:18,369
But I just can't.

1054
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,966
Katie?

1055
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,513
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1056
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,879
Sectumsempra!

1057
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:41,762
Vulnera Sanentur.

1058
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:46,266
Vulnera Sanentur.

1059
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,438
Vulnera Sanentur.

1060
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:16,088
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1061
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,594
Take my hand.

1062
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:40,487
The Room of Requirement.

1063
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,580
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1064
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:53,458
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1065
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,260
- What was that?
- What was that?

1066
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:30,704
See?

1067
01:43:31,246 --> 01:43:33,290
You never know what you'll find up here.

1068
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:56,355
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1069
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,902
Close your eyes.

1070
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:31,473
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1071
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:48,490
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1072
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:49,825
What?

1073
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:52,077
You know, hide the book?

1074
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:54,121
Oh, yeah.

1075
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,626
Ah. Dear, yes.

1076
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:02,587
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1077
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:05,966
Luck.

1078
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:10,345
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1079
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:31,700
Well, how do you feel?

1080
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:33,493
Excellent.

1081
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:36,663
Really excellent.

1082
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:41,001
Remember...

1083
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,086
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1084
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:46,256
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1085
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:47,924
Right.

1086
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:50,510
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1087
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:53,346
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1088
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,517
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1089
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,770
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1090
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:03,690
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1091
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:06,818
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1092
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:09,154
Or Felix does.

1093
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:44,106
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1094
01:46:44,272 --> 01:46:48,402
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1095
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:50,529
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1096
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:54,116
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1097
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:56,368
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1098
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:59,329
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1099
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:03,083
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1100
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:05,585
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1101
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:09,256
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1102
01:47:09,422 --> 01:47:13,218
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1103
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:16,680
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1104
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:22,102
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1105
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:23,770
Through the front door, sir.

1106
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:26,106
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1107
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:27,983
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1108
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:30,444
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1109
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:32,863
Harry!

1110
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,158
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1111
01:47:36,324 --> 01:47:39,786
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1112
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:42,539
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1113
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,089
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1114
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:53,008
...back to the castle immediately!

1115
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:56,428
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1116
01:47:57,762 --> 01:47:59,890
And what makes you say that?

1117
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:02,559
No idea.

1118
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,734
Horace.

1119
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:16,656
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1120
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,326
A dead one, I think, sir.

1121
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:21,661
Good God.

1122
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:25,373
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1123
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:29,127
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1124
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:33,506
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1125
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:37,469
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1126
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:39,846
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1127
01:48:40,263 --> 01:48:42,224
Not to mention the pincers.

1128
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,480
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1129
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:52,567
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1130
01:48:52,734 --> 01:48:56,821
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1131
01:48:56,988 --> 01:48:59,199
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1132
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:01,993
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1133
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,080
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1134
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:06,456
My thoughts exactly.

1135
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:13,129
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1136
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:18,385
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1137
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:21,513
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1138
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:25,350
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1139
01:49:26,768 --> 01:49:28,353
Oh, dear.

1140
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:41,283
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1141
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:43,076
He had a family, I trust?

1142
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:44,744
Oh, yeah.

1143
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:51,585

[HAGRID & SLUGHORN LAUGHING]

1153
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:37,756
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1154
01:50:37,922 --> 01:50:41,635
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1155
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:46,973
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1156
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:52,312
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1157
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:54,064
Poof.

1158
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:57,442
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1159
01:50:57,609 --> 01:51:01,321
But that's life, I suppose.

1160
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:06,826
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1161
01:51:06,993 --> 01:51:10,663
- Poof.
- Poof.

1162
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:28,348
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1163
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:33,645
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1164
01:51:34,562 --> 01:51:37,524
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1165
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:41,861
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1166
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:45,865
As I watched, it sank.

1167
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,203
Just before it reached the bottom...

1168
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:51,830
...it transformed...

1169
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:55,041
...into a wee fish.

1170
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,837
It was beautiful magic.

1171
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:02,090
Wondrous to behold.

1172
01:52:04,717 --> 01:52:07,470
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1173
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:10,890
Your mother.

1174
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:15,437
The day I came downstairs...

1175
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:18,690
...the day the bowl was empty...

1176
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:22,402
...was the day your mother...

1177
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:28,408
I know why you're here.

1178
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,413
But I can't help you.

1179
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:36,916
It would ruin me.

1180
01:52:40,628 --> 01:52:43,089
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1181
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:45,467
The night I got this?

1182
01:52:47,218 --> 01:52:48,845
Because of her.

1183
01:52:49,762 --> 01:52:51,556
Because she sacrificed herself.

1184
01:52:51,973 --> 01:52:54,350
Because she refused to step aside.

1185
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:57,729
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1186
01:52:57,896 --> 01:53:01,608
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1187
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:04,569
I'm going to tell you something.

1188
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:08,448
Something others have only guessed at.

1189
01:53:10,408 --> 01:53:11,910
It's true.

1190
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:13,787
I am the Chosen One.

1191
01:53:14,787 --> 01:53:16,998
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1192
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:20,460
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1193
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:23,004
...and I need to know what you told him.

1194
01:53:23,713 --> 01:53:26,132
Be brave, professor.

1195
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,844
Be brave like my mother.

1196
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:33,806
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1197
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,227
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1198
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:43,441
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1199
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:57,121
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1200
01:53:59,123 --> 01:54:02,418
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1201
01:54:39,163 --> 01:54:41,875
I was in the library the other night...

1202
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:44,210
...in the Restricted Section...

1203
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:48,715
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1204
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:52,760
It's called, as I understand it...

1205
01:54:54,053 --> 01:54:55,388
...a Horcrux.

1206
01:54:57,223 --> 01:54:59,976
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1207
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:03,062
I came across the term while reading...

1208
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:06,232
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1209
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,151
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1210
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:10,904
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1211
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:12,614
Which is...

1212
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,575
...why I came to you.

1213
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:24,042
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1214
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:26,836
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1215
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:33,426
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1216
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:37,221
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1217
01:55:37,388 --> 01:55:38,514
Protected?

1218
01:55:38,681 --> 01:55:41,893
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1219
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:45,772
In other words, you cannot die.

1220
01:55:52,945 --> 01:55:56,115
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1221
01:55:56,282 --> 01:55:59,077
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1222
01:56:00,286 --> 01:56:01,788
Murder.

1223
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:03,623
Yes.

1224
01:56:04,165 --> 01:56:09,087
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1225
01:56:09,962 --> 01:56:14,717
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1226
01:56:14,884 --> 01:56:16,386
Seven?

1227
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:22,433
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1228
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:26,354
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1229
01:56:27,522 --> 01:56:30,566
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1230
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:36,656
Of course, sir.

1231
01:56:39,617 --> 01:56:41,619
It'll be our little secret.

1232
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,671
Sir.

1233
01:57:07,061 --> 01:57:09,188
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1234
01:57:09,355 --> 01:57:12,024
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1235
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:15,319
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1236
01:57:15,486 --> 01:57:16,529
What are they exactly?

1237
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:20,033
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1238
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:24,912
A ring, for example.

1239
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:27,039
Or a book.

1240
01:57:28,332 --> 01:57:30,710
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1241
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:33,337
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1242
01:57:33,504 --> 01:57:35,798
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1243
01:57:35,965 --> 01:57:37,884
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1244
01:57:38,051 --> 01:57:43,055
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1245
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:45,224
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1246
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:50,354
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1247
01:57:50,521 --> 01:57:54,400
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1248
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:55,735
One destroys Voldemort.

1249
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:58,821
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1250
01:57:58,988 --> 01:58:02,241
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1251
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:18,091
...leaves traces.

1252
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:27,975
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1253
01:58:28,142 --> 01:58:30,436
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1254
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:34,357
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1255
01:58:34,524 --> 01:58:38,611
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1256
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:44,826
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1257
01:58:57,588 --> 01:58:59,131
It's time, Harry.

1258
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:03,594
Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?

1259
01:59:03,594 --> 01:59:05,805
If one wants it to be, why?

1260
01:59:05,805 --> 01:59:09,517
Well, then, that would explain why I
thought Malfoy was leaving the castle...

1261
01:59:09,517 --> 01:59:11,477
...but he was disappearing off the map.
He was just going to the Room of Requirement.

1262
01:59:13,229 --> 01:59:16,983
Of course. And then that would
explain the vanishing cabinet as well.

1263
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:19,026
-Yeah.
-No, I got a letter from Dad this morning.

1264
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:20,820
The one at Borgin and Burkes is still there.

1265
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,780
No, I'm telling you, I saw it.

1266
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,244
What if there were two vanishing cabinets?

1267
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:31,914
What if there are?

1268
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:34,458
I don't know.

1269
01:59:37,378 --> 01:59:39,171
Good luck, mate.

1270
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:43,676
I don't need luck.
I'll be with Dumbledore.

1271
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:46,804
[BELL RINGING]

1272
01:59:47,805 --> 01:59:50,057
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1273
01:59:50,266 --> 01:59:52,852
...that you take too much for granted?

1274
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:58,065
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1275
01:59:58,274 --> 02:00:00,359
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1276
02:00:01,277 --> 02:00:07,033
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1277
02:00:25,426 --> 02:00:27,053
Oh, Harry.

1278
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,974
You need a shave, my friend.

1279
02:00:34,769 --> 02:00:38,981
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1280
02:00:39,148 --> 02:00:43,110
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1281
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:47,031
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1282
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:48,991
I'm an old man.

1283
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:50,826
You still look the same to me, sir.

1284
02:00:52,286 --> 02:00:55,289
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1285
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:58,668
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1286
02:01:01,462 --> 02:01:05,925
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1287
02:01:06,133 --> 02:01:09,595
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1288
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:11,597
But there is one condition:

1289
02:01:11,764 --> 02:01:14,976
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1290
02:01:15,851 --> 02:01:17,478
Yes, sir.

1291
02:01:17,645 --> 02:01:19,772
You do understand what I'm saying?

1292
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:22,858
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1293
02:01:23,025 --> 02:01:25,361
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1294
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:29,532
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1295
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:36,288
Your word, Harry.

1296
02:01:37,915 --> 02:01:39,417
My word.

1297
02:01:40,209 --> 02:01:41,877
Take my arm.

1298
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,715
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1299
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:49,844
Well, being me has its privileges.

1300
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:38,726
This is the place.

1301
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,103
Oh, yes.

1302
02:02:42,021 --> 02:02:44,607
This place has known magic.

1303
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:57,828
Where you stand, Harry,
Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago.

1304
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:06,420
One wintery afternoon, he lured two
young classmates to this cave.

1305
02:03:07,254 --> 02:03:09,840
What happened is unclear...

1306
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:15,971
...but this much is known,
the children were damaged.

1307
02:03:22,895 --> 02:03:24,438
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1308
02:03:24,605 --> 02:03:26,023
...payment must be made.

1309
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:29,819
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1310
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:33,239
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1311
02:03:33,697 --> 02:03:36,408
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1312
02:03:58,305 --> 02:04:02,935
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1313
02:04:03,102 --> 02:04:06,439
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1314
02:04:09,024 --> 02:04:10,443
Careful.

1315
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:35,050
There it is.

1316
02:04:36,594 --> 02:04:39,305
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1317
02:05:01,493 --> 02:05:03,329
If you would, Harry.

1318
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:53,003
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1319
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:55,047
Oh, yes.

1320
02:06:06,141 --> 02:06:07,726
It has to be drunk.

1321
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:10,729
All of it has to be drunk.

1322
02:06:11,564 --> 02:06:14,900
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1323
02:06:15,067 --> 02:06:17,444
This potion might paralyze me.

1324
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:19,572
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1325
02:06:20,364 --> 02:06:23,659
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1326
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:25,828
You are not to indulge these requests.

1327
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:29,498
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1328
02:06:29,707 --> 02:06:32,167
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1329
02:06:32,626 --> 02:06:34,753
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1330
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:40,342
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1331
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:46,348
Your good health, Harry.

1332
02:07:02,489 --> 02:07:03,741
Professor.

1333
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:07,077
Professor!

1334
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:15,294
Harry.

1335
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:17,921
Professor, can you hear me?

1336
02:07:19,256 --> 02:07:20,424
Professor.

1337
02:07:35,856 --> 02:07:36,940
No. Don't.

1338
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:39,443
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1339
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:50,621
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1340
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:55,209
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1341
02:07:55,376 --> 02:07:57,503
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1342
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:59,963
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1343
02:08:01,882 --> 02:08:02,966
It's my fault.

1344
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:05,803
It's all my fault.

1345
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,306
It's my fault.

1346
02:08:09,473 --> 02:08:12,851
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1347
02:08:13,519 --> 02:08:15,813
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1348
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:17,856
- I promise.
- No.

1349
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:20,275
Please.

1350
02:08:44,425 --> 02:08:45,884
Harry.

1351
02:08:53,016 --> 02:08:54,017
Water.

1352
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,145
Water.

1353
02:08:56,353 --> 02:08:58,147
Water.

1354
02:09:04,653 --> 02:09:06,447
You did it, sir.

1355
02:09:06,613 --> 02:09:08,073
Look.

1356
02:09:10,075 --> 02:09:11,326
Harry.

1357
02:09:12,703 --> 02:09:14,037
Water.

1358
02:09:15,789 --> 02:09:17,458
Aguamenti.

1359
02:09:17,666 --> 02:09:19,126
Water.

1360
02:09:55,287 --> 02:09:56,663
Lumos.

1361
02:10:25,108 --> 02:10:26,985
Lumos Maxima!

1362
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:38,330
Harry.
